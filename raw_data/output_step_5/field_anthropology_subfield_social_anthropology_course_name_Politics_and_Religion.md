# Politics and Religion: Exploring the Intersection":

## Foreward

In the pages that follow, we embark on a journey to explore the intricate and often complex relationship between politics and religion. This book, "Politics and Religion: Exploring the Intersection", aims to shed light on the myriad ways in which these two seemingly disparate domains intersect, interact, and influence each other. 

Religion, as we know, has been a potent force in human societies since time immemorial. It has shaped cultures, civilizations, and individual lives in profound ways. Politics, on the other hand, is the mechanism through which societies organize themselves, make collective decisions, and resolve conflicts. The intersection of these two domains is a fascinating and complex terrain, filled with paradoxes, conflicts, and synergies.

The book begins by examining the role of religion in politics. It delves into how religion has been a source of some of the most remarkable political mobilizations of our times. It explores the various political doctrines that have been directly influenced or inspired by religions, such as Islamism, Christian political movements, and Hindu nationalism, among others.

The book also delves into the darker side of this intersection, exploring the phenomenon of religious terrorism. It examines how religious beliefs and doctrines have been used to justify acts of violence and terror, from Islamic terrorism to Christian terrorism, and from Saffron terror to Sikh terrorism.

In the subsequent sections, the book explores the various religious political issues that societies grapple with. These may involve, but are not limited to, debates on religious freedom, the role of religion in public life, the relationship between church and state, and the impact of religious beliefs on social and political policies.

Throughout the book, we strive to maintain a balanced and nuanced perspective, recognizing the diversity and complexity of the issues at hand. We draw on a wide range of sources, from historical records and religious texts to contemporary political and social research, to provide a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the intersection between politics and religion.

As you turn the pages, we hope that you will find this exploration both enlightening and thought-provoking. We invite you to join us in this journey, to question, to reflect, and to deepen your understanding of the complex and fascinating relationship between politics and religion.

## Chapter: The Sociology of Religion

### Introduction

Religion, as a social institution, has been a subject of scholarly interest for centuries. It has been analyzed, dissected, and studied from various perspectives, each offering unique insights into its nature and impact on society. In this chapter, we delve into the sociology of religion, exploring its intricate relationship with society and its influence on social structures and interactions.

The sociology of religion is a fascinating field that investigates the practices, beliefs, and organizational forms of religion using the tools and methods of sociology. This discipline seeks to understand religion in a social context, examining how religious beliefs and practices shape society and, conversely, how societal factors influence religion. 

In this chapter, we will explore the various theories and perspectives that sociologists have developed to understand religion's role in society. We will delve into the ways religion can both unify and divide communities, influence social norms and values, and shape political landscapes. We will also examine how religion interacts with other social institutions, such as education, politics, and the economy, creating a complex web of interdependencies and influences.

As we navigate through this chapter, we will also consider the challenges and controversies in the sociology of religion. We will discuss the difficulties in defining religion, the tension between secularization and religious revival, and the role of religion in social change and conflict. 

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the sociology of religion, offering a foundation for further exploration and discussion. It is our hope that through this exploration, readers will gain a deeper understanding of the complex and multifaceted relationship between religion and society.

### Section: 2.1 Introduction to the Sociology of Religion:

The sociology of religion is a subfield of sociology that seeks to understand the ways in which religion shapes society and vice versa. It is a discipline that uses the tools and methods of sociology to study the beliefs, practices, and organizational forms of religion. This objective investigation may include the use of both quantitative methods, such as surveys, polls, demographic and census analysis, and qualitative approaches, such as participant observation, interviewing, and analysis of archival, historical, and documentary materials.

#### 2.1a Definition of Sociology of Religion

The sociology of religion can be defined as the systematic study of the relationship between religion and society. It is a discipline that seeks to understand how religious beliefs, practices, and institutions shape social structures and interactions, and how, in turn, societal factors influence religious beliefs and practices. 

The sociology of religion emerged as a distinct academic discipline in the late 19th century, with the work of Émile Durkheim, who studied the relationship between religion and social cohesion. Durkheim's work, along with that of other early sociologists like Karl Marx and Max Weber, laid the foundation for the sociology of religion as we know it today.

The sociology of religion is not concerned with assessing the validity of religious beliefs. Instead, it focuses on understanding the social and cultural contexts in which these beliefs are formed and practiced. This approach requires what Peter L. Berger has described as inherent "methodological atheism", meaning that sociologists of religion must suspend their own religious beliefs and biases in order to objectively study the religious beliefs and practices of others.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various theories and perspectives within the sociology of religion, explore the role of religion in social change and conflict, and examine the challenges and controversies in this fascinating field of study.

#### 2.1b Importance of Sociology of Religion

The sociology of religion plays a crucial role in understanding the complex interplay between religion and society. It provides a lens through which we can examine the influence of religion on social structures, norms, and behaviors, and vice versa. This understanding is essential for several reasons.

Firstly, religion is a significant social institution that affects a large portion of the global population. According to Pew Research Center, more than 84% of the world's population identifies with a religious group. Understanding the sociology of religion can help us comprehend the motivations, behaviors, and decision-making processes of these individuals, which can have profound implications for politics, economics, and social policy.

Secondly, the sociology of religion can shed light on social change and conflict. As noted in the conflict theory, societies are often defined through conflicts produced by inequality. Religion can both contribute to and alleviate such conflicts. For instance, religious beliefs can be used to justify social inequalities, but they can also inspire movements for social justice and equality. Understanding these dynamics can help policymakers and social activists address societal issues more effectively.

Thirdly, the sociology of religion can contribute to our understanding of social cohesion and integration. Durkheim's work highlighted the role of religion in promoting social cohesion by creating shared beliefs and values. In contemporary society, where religious diversity is increasing, understanding how different religious groups coexist and interact is crucial for promoting social harmony.

Lastly, the sociology of religion can provide insights into individual and collective identity. Religion often plays a significant role in shaping people's identities and their sense of belonging to a community. Studying the sociology of religion can help us understand these identity formations and their implications for social interaction and cohesion.

In the following sections, we will explore these aspects in more detail, examining the various sociological theories and perspectives that have been used to study the relationship between religion and society.

#### 2.1c Key Concepts in Sociology of Religion

The sociology of religion is a broad field with numerous key concepts. In this section, we will explore some of these concepts, including the multidimensional measurement of religiousness/spirituality, the components of religiosity, and the intersection of religion with politics and society.

##### Multidimensional Measurement of Religiousness/Spirituality

The multidimensional measurement of religiousness/spirituality is a concept that recognizes the complexity and diversity of religious experiences. It suggests that religiousness and spirituality cannot be measured by a single scale or dimension, but rather require multiple scales to capture their various aspects (Fetzer Institute, 1999, 2003). 

For instance, the Daily Spiritual Experience Scale (DSES) is one such multidimensional measure that has been translated into multiple languages, including Mandarin Chinese, Korean, German, Greek, Vietnamese, French, and Spanish. This scale measures an individual's perception of the transcendent (God, the divine) in daily life and the perception's impact on one's feeling and actions.

##### Components of Religiosity

Religiosity is another complex concept in the sociology of religion. It refers to the degree of religious belief, practice, and spirituality in an individual's life. Numerous studies have identified multiple dimensions of religiosity, often using factor analysis (Brink, 1993; Hill & Hood, 1999).

For example, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham, and Pitcher (1986) identified six dimensions of religiosity, based on three components of religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (affect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). Each of these components was cross-classified, resulting in six dimensions.

These dimensions highlight the fact that an individual's religiosity can manifest in various ways. For instance, a person may accept the truthfulness of the Bible (belief dimension), but never attend a church or belong to an organized religion (practice dimension). Alternatively, an individual may not hold orthodox Christian doctrines (belief dimension), but attend a charismatic worship service (practice dimension) to develop a sense of oneness with the divine (spirituality dimension).

##### Intersection of Religion with Politics and Society

The intersection of religion with politics and society is a key area of focus in the sociology of religion. Religion can significantly influence political beliefs, social norms, and behaviors, and vice versa. Understanding this intersection can provide valuable insights into social change, conflict, cohesion, and identity formation.

For example, religious beliefs can be used to justify social inequalities, but they can also inspire movements for social justice and equality. Similarly, religion can promote social cohesion by creating shared beliefs and values, but it can also lead to conflict and division when different religious groups coexist in the same society.

In conclusion, the sociology of religion is a rich and complex field that offers valuable insights into the role of religion in society. By understanding key concepts such as the multidimensional measurement of religiousness/spirituality, the components of religiosity, and the intersection of religion with politics and society, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between religion and society.

### Section: 2.2 Historical Perspectives on Religion:

#### 2.2a Ancient Religions

The historical perspectives on religion provide a rich tapestry of beliefs, rituals, and spiritual practices that have shaped societies and cultures across the world. In this section, we will delve into the ancient religions of various regions, including the Near East, Greater Iran, Egypt, Anatolia, and the mystery religions of ancient Greece.

##### Near East: Zushakon and Others

The ancient Near East was a cradle of early religions, many of which have left indelible marks on the religious landscape of the world. One such deity was Zushakon, a figure in the pantheon of Henry Kuttner's deities. The religions of the ancient Near East were diverse and complex, often intertwining with the political and social structures of the time.

##### Greater Iran: Zoroastrianism and Beyond

In the lands of ancient Iran, a diversity of spiritual beliefs thrived. These included Zoroastrianism, Mazdakism, Manichaeism, Yazdanism, Mandeanism, and others. For instance, ancient Mitanni, centered in modern-day Kurdistan, was discovered to have a history of Zoroastrian practices. These religions, while distinct, often shared common themes and deities, reflecting the interconnectedness of the ancient Iranian cultures.

##### Egypt: Syncretism and the Gods

The dominant religious rituals and beliefs of ancient Egypt were characterized by a process of merging and development over time. A notable example of this is the syncretism of the gods Ra and Amun into a single god, Amun-Ra. This should be distinguished from mere groupings, also referred to as "families", such as Amun, Mut, and Khonsu. Over time, gods took part in multiple syncretic relationships, for instance, the combination of Ra and Horus into Ra-Herakty, and Ptah, Seker, and Osiris into "Ptah-Seker-Osiris".

##### Anatolia: Influence of Mesopotamian Mythology

The religion of the Hittites and Luwians in ancient Anatolia was heavily influenced by Mesopotamian mythology, yet it retained noticeable Indo-European elements. For example, Tarhunt, the God of thunder, and his conflict with the Serpent-God Illuyanka, reflect the Indo-European mythological theme of a storm god battling a sea serpent. Tarhunt's son, Telepinu, and daughter, Inara, were also significant figures in the Hittite pantheon.

##### Mystery Religions: The Cults of Ancient Greece

For those not satisfied by the public cult of the gods in ancient Greece, various mystery religions offered an alternative. These operated as cults into which members had to be initiated to learn their secrets. They offered religious consolations that traditional religion could not provide: a chance at mystical awakening, a systematic religious doctrine, a map to the afterlife, communal worship, and a band of spiritual fellowship. Some of these mysteries, like the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, were ancient and local. Others, like the mysteries of Dionysus, were spread from place to place.

In the next section, we will continue our exploration of historical perspectives on religion, focusing on the religions of the classical period.

#### 2.2b Medieval Religions

The Middle Ages, also known as the medieval period, was a time of significant religious evolution and conflict. This era, spanning from the 5th to the 15th century, saw the rise and fall of various religious orders, the schism of the Christian church, and the advent of the Crusades. 

##### The East-West Schism

The East-West Schism of 1054, also known as the Great Schism, marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity. This event formally separated the Christian church into two parts: Roman Catholicism in Western Europe and Eastern Orthodoxy in the east. The schism occurred when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch Michael I excommunicated each other, primarily over disputes regarding the use of unleavened bread in the liturgy, fasting days, the existence of papal authority over the four Eastern patriarchs, and disagreement over the filioque[^1^].

##### The Crusades

The Crusades, occurring between the 11th and 13th centuries, were a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Catholic Church. The initial intent was to reestablish Christian rule in "The Holy Land" by taking the area from the Muslim Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimids had captured Palestine in AD 970, lost it to the Seljuk Turks in 1073, and recaptured it in 1098, just before they lost it again in 1099 as a result of the First Crusade[^2^].

##### Military Orders

In the context of the Crusades, monastic military orders were founded that would become the template for the late medieval chivalric orders. The Knights Templar, a Christian military order founded after the First Crusade, played a significant role in protecting Christian pilgrims from hostile locals and highway bandits. The order was deeply involved in banking, and in 1307 Philip the Fair (Philippine le Bel) had the entire order arrested in France and dismantled on charges of heresy[^3^].

The Knights Hospitaller, originally a Christian organization founded in Jerusalem in 1080, provided care for poor, sick, or injured pilgrims to the Holy Land. After Jerusalem was taken in the First Crusade, it became a religious/military order[^4^].

The Middle Ages was a period of profound religious transformation, marked by schisms, wars, and the rise of religious orders. These events have had a lasting impact on the religious landscape of the world, shaping the beliefs and practices of millions of people to this day.

#### 2.2c Modern Religions

As we move from the medieval period into the modern era, we see a continuation of the religious evolution that began in earlier times. The modern period, spanning from the 16th century to the present, has been marked by significant religious developments, including the Protestant Reformation, the rise of secularism, and the emergence of new religious movements.

##### The Protestant Reformation

The Protestant Reformation, which began in the 16th century, was a major schism within Christianity initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers in 16th-century Europe[^4^]. This movement led to the creation of various Protestant denominations that rejected the authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church, emphasizing instead the Bible as the sole source of divine authority[^4^].

##### The Rise of Secularism

The modern era has also been marked by the rise of secularism, a philosophical belief system that rejects religion, or the belief in a higher power, as the basis of morality and decision-making[^5^]. This shift has been driven in part by scientific advancements and the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and individualism[^5^].

##### New Religious Movements

The modern era has also seen the emergence of new religious movements (NRMs), which are faith-based groups with practices and teachings that are typically distinct from those of more traditional religions[^6^]. Some NRMs, such as the Church of Scientology and the Unification Church, have gained significant followings and have had a substantial impact on contemporary society[^6^].

##### Modern Church

The Modern Church, a charitable society promoting liberal Christian theology, is an example of a modern religious organization that has emerged in response to contemporary societal issues. The Modern Church defends liberal positions on a wide range of issues including gender, sexuality, interfaith relations, religion and science, and biblical scholarship[^7^]. Its theological principles are opposed to dogmatism and value critical scholarship of the Bible and Christian history[^7^].

In conclusion, the modern era has been a time of significant religious change and development. From the Protestant Reformation to the rise of secularism and the emergence of new religious movements, the landscape of religion has been continually evolving in response to societal changes and advancements.

### Section: 2.3 Theories of Secularization:

#### 2.3a Definition of Secularization

Secularization, in the context of sociology, is a complex concept that generally signifies a shift from a religious to a more worldly level[^7^]. It's important to note that secularization does not necessarily lead to atheism or irreligion, nor is it inherently opposed to religion[^7^]. The term has various connotations, such as the differentiation of secular from religious domains, the marginalization of religion in those domains, or the transformation of religion as a result of its recharacterization (e.g., as a private concern or as a non-political matter)[^7^].

The origins of secularism can be traced back to the Bible itself and have been developed throughout Christian history into the modern era[^7^]. The term "secular" has been a part of the Christian church's history, which even had "secular clergy" in the medieval period[^7^]. Furthermore, secular and religious entities were not separated in the medieval period, but coexisted and interacted naturally[^7^].

The term "secularization" can also refer to the lifting of monastic restrictions from a member of the clergy, and to deconsecration, which is the removal of the consecration of a religious building so that it may be used for other purposes[^7^]. The first use of "secular" as a change from religion to the mundane is from the 16th century, referring to the transformation of ecclesiastical possessions for civil purposes, such as converting monasteries into hospitals[^7^]. By the 19th century, it gained traction as a political object of secularist movements[^7^]. In the 20th century, "secularization" had diversified into various versions in light of the diversity of experiences from different cultures and institutions[^7^].

Scholars recognize that secularity is structured by Protestant models of Christianity, shares a parallel language to religion, and intensifies Protestant features such as iconoclasm, skepticism towards rituals, and emphasizes beliefs[^7^]. In doing so, secularism perpetuates Christian traits under a different name[^7^].

The "secularization thesis" expresses the idea that as societies progress, particularly through modernization and rationalization, religion loses its authority in all aspects of social life and governance[^8^]. This thesis is central to several theories of societal interaction with religion, as it postulates a trend towards the marginalization of religion in modern societies[^8^].

#### 2.3b Classical Theories of Secularization

The classical theories of secularization are rooted in the works of key sociologists such as Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Karl Marx[^8^]. These theories provide a framework for understanding the process of secularization and its implications on society.

Max Weber's theory of secularization is centered on the concept of "disenchantment"[^8^]. Weber argued that the modern world is characterized by rationalization and intellectualization, which leads to the "disenchantment of the world" - a shift away from religious explanations and towards scientific and rational ones[^8^]. This process, Weber believed, led to the decline of the influence of religion in society[^8^].

Emile Durkheim, on the other hand, saw secularization as a shift from "mechanical solidarity" to "organic solidarity"[^8^]. In mechanical solidarity, social cohesion is based on shared beliefs and values, often religious in nature. As societies become more complex and differentiated, Durkheim argued, they move towards organic solidarity, where social cohesion is based on interdependence and specialization[^8^]. This shift, Durkheim believed, led to the privatization of religion and its decreasing influence on public life[^8^].

Karl Marx viewed religion as a tool of social control used by the ruling class to maintain their power[^8^]. He famously referred to religion as the "opium of the people" - a means of providing false comfort and hope to the oppressed masses[^8^]. In Marx's view, as societies become more secular, religion loses its power as a tool of social control[^8^].

These classical theories of secularization provide a foundation for understanding the complex relationship between religion and society. However, they have been critiqued and expanded upon by contemporary scholars, who argue that secularization is not a linear or inevitable process, but rather a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that varies across different societies and historical periods[^8^].

In the next section, we will explore these contemporary theories of secularization and their implications for our understanding of the intersection between politics and religion.

#### 2.3c Contemporary Theories of Secularization

Contemporary theories of secularization have built upon, critiqued, and expanded the classical theories, offering new perspectives on the complex relationship between religion and society. These theories often challenge the notion that secularization is a linear or inevitable process, instead emphasizing the multifaceted and variable nature of secularization across different societies and historical periods[^9^].

One of the most influential contemporary theorists of secularization is Charles Taylor, whose work "A Secular Age" provides a comprehensive exploration of secularization in the modern West[^10^]. Taylor rejects the "subtraction" theory of secularization, which posits that religion has been 'subtracted' or removed from society[^10^]. Instead, he argues that secularization is the result of a movement of Reform within Christianity, which aimed to elevate everyone to the highest levels of religious devotion and practice[^10^]. This movement, Taylor argues, led to a disciplinary society that took action against rowdiness and indiscipline, and ultimately encouraged an anthropocentrism that paved the way for a godless humanism[^10^].

Taylor's theory of secularization also emphasizes the role of social self-understanding in the process of secularization[^10^]. He identifies three key forms of social self-understanding: the economy, the public sphere, and the practices and outlooks of democratic self-rule[^10^]. Both the economy and the public sphere, Taylor argues, are conceived as existing independent of political power[^10^]. This shift in social self-understanding, according to Taylor, has contributed to the rise of exclusive humanism and a move away from traditional religion[^10^].

Another important contemporary theory of secularization is the "religious economies" model, which views religion as a market-like commodity[^11^]. According to this theory, the vitality of religion in a society depends on the level of competition among religious groups[^11^]. In societies where there is a high level of religious competition, religion is likely to be more vibrant and influential[^11^]. Conversely, in societies where there is little religious competition, religion is likely to be less vibrant and influential[^11^].

These contemporary theories of secularization provide a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between religion and society. They highlight the multifaceted nature of secularization and challenge the notion that secularization is a linear or inevitable process. As such, they offer valuable insights for sociologists, political scientists, and other scholars interested in the intersection of religion and politics.

#### 2.4a Critiques of Secularization Theory

Secularization theory, despite its widespread acceptance and influence, has not been without its critics. One of the main criticisms of secularization theory is its perceived Eurocentrism[^12^]. Critics argue that the theory is based on the specific historical and cultural experiences of Western Europe, and thus may not be applicable to other societies with different historical and cultural contexts[^12^]. This critique is particularly relevant in light of the persistence and even resurgence of religion in many parts of the world, including the United States and the Global South[^13^].

Another critique of secularization theory is its alleged reductionism. Critics argue that the theory reduces the complex and multifaceted phenomenon of religion to a single dimension, namely its public, institutional manifestations[^14^]. This critique is related to the broader debate within the sociology of religion about the definition and measurement of religiosity[^14^]. Some scholars argue for a more nuanced understanding of religion that takes into account its private, subjective, and experiential aspects[^14^].

Postliberal theology offers an alternative approach to the study of religion and society. Postliberal theologians reject the foundationalist assumptions of secularization theory, arguing instead for a post-foundational understanding of religion[^15^]. This approach emphasizes the internal coherence of religious traditions and the importance of narrative and community in shaping religious identity[^15^]. However, postliberal theology has been criticized for its alleged relativism and sectarianism, as well as its lack of accessibility to laypeople[^15^].

In response to these critiques, some scholars have proposed alternative theories of secularization. These theories often emphasize the variable and contingent nature of secularization, as well as the role of social, political, and economic factors in shaping religious change[^16^]. For example, the religious economies model views religion as a market-like commodity, with the vitality of religion in a society depending on the level of religious competition and regulation[^11^].

Despite these critiques and alternative approaches, secularization theory remains a central framework in the sociology of religion. Its enduring influence attests to the complexity of the relationship between religion and society, and the ongoing need for theoretical and empirical research in this field[^17^].

#### 2.4b Post-Secularism

Post-secularism is a theoretical framework that challenges the secularization thesis and offers an alternative perspective on the relationship between religion and politics[^16^]. It posits that the secular and the religious are not mutually exclusive categories, but rather intersect and interact in complex ways[^16^]. This perspective is particularly relevant in the context of post-Christian societies, where religion continues to play a significant role in public life, albeit in transformed and often unanticipated ways[^17^].

The concept of post-secularism emerged in response to the perceived limitations of secularization theory, including its Eurocentrism and reductionism[^16^]. It seeks to overcome these limitations by adopting a more nuanced and context-sensitive approach to the study of religion and society[^16^]. Post-secularism recognizes the diversity and fluidity of religious expressions, as well as the multiple ways in which religion can influence and be influenced by social, political, and economic processes[^16^].

In post-Christian societies, post-secularism can help to illuminate the complex dynamics of religious change. For example, it can shed light on the phenomenon of post-Christianity, where Christian values, culture, and worldviews have been gradually replaced by secular or non-Christian ones[^17^]. Post-secularism can also help to explain the persistence and even resurgence of religious beliefs and practices in these societies, despite the decline of institutional Christianity[^17^].

However, post-secularism is not without its critics. Some argue that it overstates the significance of religion in contemporary societies and underestimates the power and pervasiveness of secular ideologies[^18^]. Others question its applicability to non-Western contexts, where the boundaries between the secular and the religious may be drawn differently[^18^].

Despite these criticisms, post-secularism offers a valuable lens through which to examine the intersection of politics and religion. It invites us to rethink the binary opposition between the secular and the religious, and to explore the multiple ways in which these categories are constructed, contested, and negotiated in different social and political contexts[^16^].

#### 2.4c Religious Revivalism

Religious revivalism, as a sociological phenomenon, offers an alternative perspective to the secularization thesis and post-secularism. It refers to periods of extraordinary religious activity, characterized by widespread enthusiasm and fervor, mass conversions, and the formation of new religious movements[^19^]. The revival of 1800, also known as the Second Great Awakening, is a prime example of this phenomenon[^20^].

The revival of 1800 was a series of religious revivals that swept across the United States, particularly in the frontier regions of Kentucky and Tennessee[^20^]. These revivals were characterized by large, open-air meetings, emotional preaching, and dramatic conversions[^20^]. The revival meetings were attended by thousands of people, who traveled from far and wide to participate in the religious fervor[^20^].

The accounts of McGready, a prominent revivalist preacher, provide a vivid illustration of the scale and intensity of these revivals. According to McGready, the revivals were "the most glorious time that our guilty eyes have ever beheld"[^20^]. He reported that hundreds of people were converted at these meetings, and the excitement was so great that some attendees stayed at the meeting house through the night[^20^].

The revival of 1800 had significant social and political implications. It led to the formation of new religious movements and denominations, such as the Methodist and Baptist churches, which played a crucial role in shaping the religious landscape of the United States[^21^]. It also influenced the development of social reform movements, such as the abolitionist and temperance movements[^21^].

However, religious revivalism is not without its critiques. Some sociologists argue that it tends to foster a simplistic and emotional form of religiosity, which can lead to social division and conflict[^22^]. Others point out that religious revivals are often short-lived and fail to bring about lasting social change[^22^].

Despite these criticisms, religious revivalism provides a valuable lens through which to understand the complex interplay between religion and politics. It highlights the capacity of religion to mobilize large numbers of people and to shape social and political norms and values[^23^]. It also underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of religious belief and practice, challenging the notion of a linear progression from religious to secular societies[^23^].

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the sociology of religion, exploring its intricate relationship with politics. We have seen how religion, as a social institution, shapes and is shaped by political structures and ideologies. The interplay between religion and politics is complex and multifaceted, often influencing societal norms, laws, and public policies. 

Religion, with its profound influence on individual and collective identities, can serve as a powerful tool in political mobilization. It can foster unity and solidarity, but it can also be a source of conflict and division. Politics, on the other hand, can shape religious practices and beliefs through legislation and public policy. 

The sociology of religion, therefore, provides a critical lens through which we can understand the dynamics of power, identity, and social change in society. It underscores the importance of examining the intersection of politics and religion in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of social phenomena. 

As we continue to explore the intersection of politics and religion in subsequent chapters, it is important to keep in mind the sociological perspectives and theories discussed in this chapter. They will serve as a foundation for our further exploration and analysis.

## Chapter 3: The Economics of Religion

### Introduction

The intersection of politics and religion is a complex and multifaceted one, and nowhere is this more evident than in the realm of economics. The economics of religion is a field of study that explores the relationship between religious beliefs, religious institutions, and economic behavior. It seeks to understand how religion influences economic activities and how economic factors can impact religious practices and institutions.

In this chapter, we delve into the intricate dynamics of the economics of religion. We will explore how religious beliefs and practices can shape economic behaviors, such as work ethics, consumption patterns, and charitable giving. We will also examine how religious institutions, like churches, mosques, and temples, function as economic entities, generating income, employing people, and contributing to the economy.

Moreover, we will investigate the role of religion in economic development and inequality. We will discuss theories and empirical studies that suggest a link between religious beliefs and economic growth, as well as those that argue for a relationship between religion and economic inequality.

Finally, we will consider the economic implications of religious freedom and religious conflict. We will look at how religious freedom can influence economic prosperity and how religious conflict can have economic costs.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the economics of religion, drawing on a wide range of academic research and real-world examples. It is our hope that by the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding of the complex ways in which religion and economics intersect and influence each other.

### Section: 3.1 Introduction to the Economics of Religion:

The economics of religion is a fascinating and complex field that applies economic principles and methodologies to the study of religious behaviors and institutions. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines elements of economics, sociology, psychology, and religious studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between religion and economic activities.

#### 3.1a Definition of Economics of Religion

The economics of religion is defined as the application of economic techniques and theories to the study of religion. It investigates the relationship between economic and religious behaviors, exploring how religious beliefs and practices influence economic activities and how economic factors can impact religious institutions and practices.

The field traces its roots back to Adam Smith, who in his seminal work "The Wealth of Nations" (1776), suggested that religious organizations are subject to market forces, incentives, and competition, just like any other sector of the economy. This perspective laid the groundwork for the economic analysis of religion, establishing the idea that religious institutions are economic entities that operate within a market framework.

The economics of religion also examines the causal influence of religion in microeconomics to explain individual behavior and in macroeconomic determinants of economic growth. It explores how religious beliefs and values can shape individual economic behaviors, such as work ethics, consumption patterns, and charitable giving. At the macro level, it investigates the role of religion in economic development and inequality, examining theories and empirical studies that suggest a link between religious beliefs and economic growth, as well as those that argue for a relationship between religion and economic inequality.

Furthermore, the economics of religion considers the economic implications of religious freedom and religious conflict. It looks at how religious freedom can influence economic prosperity and how religious conflict can have economic costs. 

In summary, the economics of religion is a multidisciplinary field that applies economic principles and methodologies to the study of religion, exploring the complex and multifaceted relationship between religious beliefs, practices, institutions, and economic activities.

#### 3.1b Importance of Economics of Religion

The economics of religion is a crucial field of study due to its profound implications on both individual and societal levels. It provides a unique lens through which we can understand the complex interplay between religious beliefs and economic behaviors, and how these interactions shape our societies and economies.

Firstly, the economics of religion helps us understand the motivations behind individual economic behaviors. As Azzi and Ehrenberg (1975) proposed, individuals allocate time and money to secular and religious institutions to maximize utility in this life and the afterlife. This perspective can shed light on why people make certain economic decisions, such as charitable giving or ethical consumption, that may not be fully explained by traditional economic theories.

Secondly, the economics of religion can provide insights into the role of religion in economic development and inequality. For instance, Max Weber's theory of the Protestant ethic suggests that the Protestant reformation played a significant role in the advent of modern capitalism. By examining the relationship between religious beliefs and economic growth, we can gain a better understanding of the historical and contemporary dynamics of economic development.

Thirdly, the economics of religion can inform policy-making. Understanding the economic implications of religious freedom and religious discrimination can guide policymakers in promoting economic growth and social cohesion. For example, policies that protect religious freedom can foster a diverse and inclusive economy, while policies that address religious discrimination can help reduce economic inequality.

Lastly, the economics of religion can contribute to the broader understanding of the market forces that shape religious institutions. As Adam Smith suggested, religious organizations are subject to market forces, incentives, and competition, just like any other sector of the economy. This perspective can help us understand the dynamics of religious competition, the market for religious goods and services, and the economic viability of religious institutions.

In conclusion, the economics of religion is a vital field of study that offers valuable insights into the complex interactions between religion and economics. By exploring these interactions, we can gain a deeper understanding of our societies and economies, and inform policies that promote economic growth and social cohesion.

#### 3.1c Key Concepts in Economics of Religion

The economics of religion encompasses several key concepts that help us understand the intricate relationship between religious beliefs and economic behaviors. These concepts include, but are not limited to, religious capital, religious market theory, and the secularization hypothesis.

##### Religious Capital

Religious capital refers to the knowledge, experience, and social connections that individuals acquire through their religious participation (Iannaccone, 1990). It is a form of human capital that can influence individuals' economic behaviors and outcomes. For instance, religious capital can enhance individuals' work ethic, honesty, and trust, which can in turn promote economic growth (Weber, 1905). Moreover, religious capital can also affect human capital formation, as higher religious importance of literacy can drive educational attainment and economic performance (Becker and Woessmann, 2009).

##### Religious Market Theory

Religious market theory posits that religious organizations operate in a competitive market, where they offer religious goods and services to attract and retain adherents (Stark and Finke, 2000). This theory suggests that religious pluralism and competition can lead to higher levels of religious participation and vitality. It also implies that religious organizations, like other economic entities, respond to market forces, incentives, and competition. This perspective can provide insights into the dynamics of religious change and the economic implications of religious freedom and discrimination.

##### Secularization Hypothesis

The secularization hypothesis predicts that economic development reduces religious participation (Norris and Inglehart, 2004). This hypothesis is based on the assumption that as societies become more economically developed, individuals become less reliant on religious explanations and solutions, leading to a decline in religious beliefs and practices. However, the empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis is mixed, suggesting that the relationship between economic development and religion is complex and multifaceted.

In conclusion, the economics of religion involves a wide range of concepts that can help us understand the interplay between religion and economics. By exploring these concepts, we can gain a deeper understanding of how religious beliefs and practices shape economic behaviors and outcomes, and vice versa. This knowledge can inform policy-making, contribute to economic development, and enhance our understanding of the role of religion in our societies and economies.

#### 3.2a Rational Choice Theory in Religion

Rational choice theory, a fundamental concept in economics, can also be applied to understand religious behavior. This theory posits that individuals make decisions based on their own preferences and the constraints they face, aiming to maximize their net benefits (Becker, 1976). In the context of religion, this could mean that individuals choose to participate in religious activities that provide them with the highest spiritual, emotional, or social benefits, given their available time, resources, and other constraints.

##### Rational Choice and Religious Participation

Religious participation can be viewed as a rational choice made by individuals. For instance, individuals may choose to attend religious services because they derive spiritual satisfaction, emotional comfort, or social connections from such participation. These benefits can outweigh the costs, such as time and resources spent on religious activities. This perspective can help us understand why some individuals are more religiously active than others, as their cost-benefit calculations may differ based on their personal preferences, resources, and constraints.

##### Rational Choice and Religious Conversion

Rational choice theory can also shed light on religious conversion. According to this theory, individuals may convert to a different religion if they perceive that the new religion offers higher net benefits than their current religion. These benefits could include spiritual fulfillment, social acceptance, or material rewards. The costs of conversion, such as social ostracism or loss of previous religious capital, are also taken into account in this decision-making process (Stark and Finke, 2000).

##### Rational Choice and Religious Market Theory

The application of rational choice theory to religion also underpins the religious market theory. This theory suggests that religious organizations, like firms in a market, compete to attract and retain adherents by offering religious goods and services. Adherents, in turn, choose among these offerings based on their preferences and constraints, just as consumers in a market choose among different products or services (Iannaccone, 1990).

In conclusion, rational choice theory provides a useful framework for understanding religious behavior from an economic perspective. It suggests that religious behavior, like other forms of human behavior, can be influenced by individual preferences, constraints, and cost-benefit calculations. However, it is important to note that this theory is not without its critics, who argue that it oversimplifies the complex motivations and experiences involved in religious behavior (Young, 1997).

#### 3.2b Supply-Side Economics of Religion

The supply-side economics of religion is a perspective that focuses on the role of religious organizations in shaping religious behavior. This approach is based on the theory of religious economy, which likens the dynamics of religious organizations to those of firms in a market economy.

##### Supply-Side Theory and Religious Market

In a religious market, religious organizations compete for followers, much like businesses compete for consumers in a commercial economy. This competition leads to a religious economy where different religious organizations offer a variety of religious products to meet the diverse demands of religious consumers (Chesnut). 

In a free market, or pluralistic religious market, many religious organizations exist and seek to appeal to certain segments of the market. These organizations cannot rely on the state for resources, so they must compete for the participation of the religious consumer. This competition among religious firms results in the specialization of religious products, allowing consumers to distinguish different organizations from others. 

##### Supply-Side Theory and Religious Participation

The supply-side theory posits that religious firms can increase the demand for religion. This is achieved by tailoring their religious products to meet the individual demands of religious consumers. For instance, religious organizations may offer different forms of worship, doctrines, or community activities to attract and retain followers. 

The supply-side theory also suggests that a competitive and pluralistic religious economy has a positive effect on levels of religious participation. This is because the competition among religious organizations leads to a greater variety of religious products, which can cater to a wider range of religious preferences and needs. 

##### Supply-Side Theory and State Favoritism

The supply-side theory also highlights the role of the state in shaping the religious economy. According to this theory, religious pluralism is only possible in the absence of state favoritism. When the state favors a particular religion, it can distort the religious market by providing resources or privileges to the favored religion, thereby reducing the competition among religious organizations (Chesnut).

In conclusion, the supply-side economics of religion provides a useful framework for understanding the dynamics of religious behavior. It emphasizes the role of religious organizations as suppliers of religious products, and highlights the importance of competition and state neutrality in promoting religious pluralism and participation.

#### 3.2c Demand-Side Economics of Religion

The demand-side economics of religion focuses on the role of religious consumers in shaping religious behavior and the religious market. This perspective is based on the theory of religious economy, which likens the dynamics of religious consumers to those of consumers in a market economy.

##### Demand-Side Theory and Religious Market

In a religious market, religious consumers have a variety of religious organizations to choose from, much like consumers in a commercial economy have a variety of businesses to patronize. This variety leads to a religious economy where different religious organizations offer a variety of religious products to meet the diverse demands of religious consumers.

In a free market, or pluralistic religious market, religious consumers have the freedom to choose from a variety of religious organizations. These consumers are not bound by state-imposed religious monopolies, and thus have the freedom to choose the religious organization that best meets their individual religious needs and preferences.

##### Demand-Side Theory and Religious Participation

The demand-side theory posits that religious consumers can influence the supply of religion. This is achieved by expressing their individual religious needs and preferences, which religious organizations must then cater to in order to attract and retain followers. For instance, if a significant number of religious consumers express a preference for a particular form of worship, religious organizations may adapt their religious products to meet this demand.

The demand-side theory also suggests that a competitive and pluralistic religious economy has a positive effect on levels of religious participation. This is because the variety of religious products available caters to a wider range of religious preferences and needs, thus encouraging more individuals to participate in religious activities.

##### Demand-Side Theory and State Favoritism

The demand-side theory also highlights the role of the state in shaping the religious market. In a free market, the state does not favor any particular religious organization, thus allowing religious consumers the freedom to choose the religious organization that best meets their individual needs and preferences. This lack of state favoritism encourages competition among religious organizations, which in turn leads to a greater variety of religious products and higher levels of religious participation. 

In conclusion, the demand-side economics of religion provides a useful framework for understanding the dynamics of the religious market and the behavior of religious consumers. By focusing on the role of religious consumers, this perspective highlights the importance of individual religious needs and preferences in shaping the religious market and influencing religious behavior.

### Section: 3.3 Religious Markets and Competition:

#### 3.3a Definition of Religious Markets

Religious markets, as defined within the context of the theory of religious economy, are analogous to commercial markets. They are arenas where different religious organizations compete for followers, much like businesses compete for consumers. In these markets, religious organizations are the suppliers, and the followers or believers are the consumers. The religious organizations offer a variety of religious products, such as doctrines, rituals, and community, to meet the diverse demands of religious consumers.

In a free market, or pluralistic religious market, a multitude of religious organizations exist and seek to appeal to certain segments of the market. These organizations cannot rely on the state for resources, so they must compete for the participation of the religious consumer. This competition among religious firms results in the specialization of products, allowing consumers to distinguish different organizations from others (Chesnut).

#### 3.3b Religious Competition and Pluralism

Religious competition and pluralism are key features of a free religious market. Pluralism refers to the existence of multiple religious organizations within the same market, each offering distinct religious products. This lack of favoritism by the state allows for a competitive and pluralistic religious economy, which has been shown to have a positive effect on levels of participation (Chesnut).

Religious competition, on the other hand, refers to the contest among religious organizations for followers. This competition drives religious organizations to innovate and adapt their religious products to meet the changing demands of religious consumers. For instance, if a significant number of religious consumers express a preference for a particular form of worship, religious organizations may adapt their religious products to meet this demand.

#### 3.3c Microeconomic Theory and Religious Markets

The microeconomic theory of the household production function and time allocation, associated with the work of Chicago economist Gary Becker, can be adapted to explain religious participation and the formation of norms in religious markets. This theory postulates stable preferences and rational choice constrained by limited human and social capital to explain behavior.

In the context of religious markets, this theory suggests that religious consumers make rational choices about their religious participation based on their individual preferences and the constraints of their available time and resources. This rational choice behavior shapes the demand for religious products and influences the supply of religion in the market.

#### 3.3b Competition in Religious Markets

Much like the competition observed in commercial markets, religious markets also exhibit competitive dynamics. The competition in religious markets, however, is not for monetary gain but for the allegiance and participation of followers. This competition can be seen in the form of religious organizations striving to offer more appealing doctrines, rituals, and community experiences to attract and retain followers.

Drawing parallels from the concept of strongholds in commercial markets, religious organizations also establish their own strongholds in the religious market. These strongholds can be seen as the unique doctrines, rituals, or community experiences that a religious organization offers, which are difficult for other organizations to replicate. These unique offerings act as barriers to entry for other religious organizations, protecting the organization's market share.

Just as firms diversify around their core to create a sphere of influence, religious organizations also diversify their offerings to create a sphere of influence among followers. This diversification can be seen in the form of different branches or sects within a religion, each offering slightly different religious products to cater to the diverse demands of religious consumers.

Religious organizations also engage in strategic interactions with other organizations. These interactions can take the form of alliances with other organizations, skirmishes over doctrinal differences, or attempts to convert followers of other organizations. The outcome of these interactions can significantly impact the market share of the involved organizations.

However, not all religious organizations are able to establish a stronghold or a sphere of influence. Smaller or niche religious organizations may only be able to create influence within a small segment of the religious market. These organizations, however, play a crucial role in maintaining the diversity and pluralism of the religious market.

In conclusion, the competition in religious markets, much like in commercial markets, is a dynamic process that shapes the religious landscape. This competition drives religious organizations to innovate and adapt, leading to a diverse and vibrant religious market.

#### 3.3c Regulation of Religious Markets

Regulation in religious markets, much like in commercial markets, plays a crucial role in maintaining fairness, preventing manipulation, and ensuring the overall health of the market. However, the nature of regulation in religious markets is unique due to the inherent characteristics of religion and its intertwining with culture, tradition, and personal beliefs.

In the context of Islamic economics, the concept of "hisbah" serves as a regulatory mechanism. As described by M. S. Naz, "hisbah" is a semi-judicial institution that has been operational since the earliest days of Islam. Its primary functions include preserving and enhancing public health and interests, protecting consumers, resolving business and labor disputes, promoting good market behavior, and ensuring their observance[^1^]. 

Islamic teachings uphold the market as the basic coordinating mechanism of the economic system, given perfect competition. This allows consumers to obtain desired goods and producers to sell their goods at a mutually acceptable price[^2^]. 

Three necessary conditions for an operational market, as stated by Nomani and Rahnema, are upheld in Islamic primary sources[^3^]. Furthermore, the general doctrine of fairness in sharia law creates an ethical economic model and forbids market manipulation. This includes practices such as inflating the price of commodities by creating artificial shortages ("Ihtekar"), overbidding for the sole purpose of driving the prices up ("Najash") and concealment of vital information in a transaction from the other party ("Ghish")[^4^].

In addition, "uninformed speculation" not based on a proper analysis of available information is forbidden because it is a form of "Qimar", or gambling, and results in accumulating "Maysir" (unearned wealth)[^5^].

Regulation in religious markets, therefore, is not only about maintaining market dynamics but also about upholding ethical standards and principles inherent in the religion itself. This intertwining of economics and ethics in religious markets presents a unique challenge for regulators and participants alike.

### Section: 3.4 Benefits and Costs of Religious Participation:

Religious participation, like any other human activity, comes with its own set of benefits and costs. These can be broadly categorized into spiritual, social, and economic benefits and costs. In this section, we will explore these categories, starting with spiritual benefits and costs.

#### 3.4a Spiritual Benefits and Costs

The spiritual benefits of religious participation are often deeply personal and subjective, making them difficult to quantify. However, they are nonetheless significant and can have profound impacts on an individual's life. 

One of the primary spiritual benefits of religious participation is the sense of purpose and meaning it can provide. Many religions offer narratives that help individuals make sense of their lives and the world around them[^6^]. For instance, the teachings of Silvanus, as outlined in the third edition of the "Teachings of Silvanus", encourage individuals to develop strength of mind and soul, guard their thoughts, and seek wisdom and knowledge[^7^]. Such teachings can provide a framework for understanding one's place in the world and a guide for moral and ethical behavior.

Religious participation can also provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be spiritually fulfilling. Many religious practices involve communal activities, such as group worship, which can foster a sense of unity and shared identity[^8^].

However, religious participation also comes with spiritual costs. For some, the teachings and doctrines of their religion may conflict with their personal beliefs or experiences, causing cognitive dissonance and spiritual distress[^9^]. Additionally, religious participation often requires a commitment of time and energy, which could be spent on other activities. 

Furthermore, religious teachings can sometimes be interpreted in ways that promote harmful behaviors or attitudes. For instance, the teachings of Silvanus warn against showing weakness to enemies and encourage the pursuit of enemies with strength[^7^]. While this can be interpreted as a call to resilience and determination, it could also be used to justify aggression or intolerance.

In conclusion, the spiritual benefits and costs of religious participation are complex and multifaceted, and they can vary greatly depending on the individual and their specific religious context. In the following subsections, we will explore the social and economic benefits and costs of religious participation.

#### 3.4b Social Benefits and Costs

The social benefits of religious participation are manifold and can significantly contribute to an individual's well-being and societal integration. 

One of the most prominent social benefits of religious participation is the sense of community it fosters[^10^]. Religious institutions often serve as social hubs, providing a space for individuals to connect with others, form relationships, and engage in communal activities. This can lead to increased social support, which has been linked to better mental and physical health outcomes[^11^].

Religious participation can also provide individuals with opportunities for social service. Many religious organizations engage in charitable activities, providing aid to those in need. This not only benefits the recipients of the aid but also provides the participants with a sense of purpose and fulfillment[^12^].

Moreover, religious participation can contribute to social cohesion and stability. Shared religious beliefs and practices can foster a sense of shared identity and mutual understanding, promoting social harmony[^13^].

However, religious participation also has social costs. For instance, religious participation may lead to social exclusion or discrimination for those who do not conform to the dominant religious norms in a given society[^14^]. This can result in social isolation and psychological distress.

Religious participation can also lead to intergroup conflict. Differences in religious beliefs and practices can create divisions between groups, leading to social tension and, in extreme cases, violence[^15^].

Furthermore, the cost of living and social security benefits can also impact religious participation. In societies where the cost of living is high, individuals may have less time and resources to devote to religious activities. On the other hand, social security benefits may provide individuals with the means to participate in religious activities that they might not otherwise be able to afford[^16^].

In conclusion, the social benefits and costs of religious participation are complex and multifaceted, and their impact can vary greatly depending on individual and societal factors. As such, they warrant careful consideration in any discussion of the economics of religion.

#### 3.4c Economic Benefits and Costs

The economic benefits and costs of religious participation are as multifaceted as the social ones. They can be analyzed from both individual and societal perspectives, and they often intersect with social and political factors.

From an individual perspective, religious participation can provide economic benefits in the form of increased social capital[^16^]. Social capital refers to the networks of relationships among people who live and work in a particular society, enabling that society to function effectively[^17^]. Religious institutions often serve as a platform for building these networks, which can lead to economic opportunities such as job referrals, business partnerships, and financial support[^18^].

Religious participation can also lead to economic costs for individuals. These costs can be direct, such as tithes, offerings, and other financial contributions to religious institutions[^19^]. They can also be indirect, such as the opportunity cost of time spent on religious activities that could otherwise be used for economically productive activities[^20^].

From a societal perspective, religious participation can contribute to economic development. For instance, religious organizations often engage in charitable activities that provide social services, such as education and healthcare, which can contribute to human capital development[^21^]. Moreover, the moral and ethical teachings of religions can foster social norms that support economic growth, such as honesty, hard work, and cooperation[^22^].

However, religious participation can also have societal economic costs. For instance, religious conflicts can lead to social instability and violence, which can disrupt economic activities and deter investment[^23^]. Moreover, the tax-exempt status of religious institutions in many countries represents a significant cost to the public treasury[^24^].

In conclusion, the economic benefits and costs of religious participation are complex and multifaceted. They are influenced by a variety of factors, including the specific religious beliefs and practices, the socio-economic context, and the individual's personal circumstances. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and costs requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates insights from economics, sociology, political science, and religious studies[^25^].

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the intricate relationship between religion and economics, exploring how these two seemingly disparate fields intersect and influence each other. We have examined the economic theories that explain religious behavior, the impact of religion on economic development, and the role of religious institutions in economic activities. 

We have seen that religious beliefs and practices can shape economic behaviors and outcomes in profound ways. For instance, religious beliefs can influence individuals' work ethics, savings habits, and attitudes towards wealth and poverty, which in turn can affect economic growth and development. 

Religious institutions, on the other hand, can play a significant role in the economy by providing social services, promoting social cohesion, and influencing economic policies. However, they can also contribute to economic inequality and conflict if they become too entangled with political power or if they promote discriminatory or exclusionary beliefs and practices.

In conclusion, the economics of religion is a complex and multifaceted field that requires a nuanced understanding of both economics and religion. By exploring this intersection, we can gain a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and economic forces that shape our world.

## Chapter: The Political Origins of Religious Violence

### Introduction

Religious violence, a term that has been at the forefront of many political and social discussions, is a complex phenomenon that has shaped the course of human history. This chapter, "The Political Origins of Religious Violence", aims to delve into the intricate relationship between politics and religion, and how this intersection has often led to instances of violence and conflict. 

The exploration begins with an examination of the historical context, tracing the roots of religious violence back to the early civilizations where politics and religion were often intertwined. It then moves on to the modern era, where the lines between politics and religion have blurred, leading to a rise in religiously motivated violence. 

The chapter also seeks to understand the role of political ideologies in shaping religious violence. It investigates how political leaders and institutions have used religion as a tool to gain power, control populations, and further their agendas, often resulting in violent conflicts. 

Furthermore, it discusses the impact of religious violence on societies and nations, and how it has influenced political landscapes worldwide. It also explores potential solutions and strategies to mitigate religious violence, emphasizing the importance of political will and international cooperation.

This chapter does not aim to vilify any religion or political ideology, but rather to shed light on the complex dynamics between politics and religion, and how these interactions can sometimes lead to violence. It is a call for understanding, dialogue, and peace in a world that is increasingly polarized along religious and political lines. 

In the end, "The Political Origins of Religious Violence" is a journey through the intricate maze of politics and religion, a journey that seeks to understand the roots of religious violence and find ways to prevent it in the future.

### Section: 4.1 Understanding Religious Violence:

#### 4.1a Definition of Religious Violence

Religious violence, as a term, encompasses a broad spectrum of violent behaviors that are either motivated by, or in reaction to, religious precepts, texts, or doctrines. It is a complex phenomenon that involves violence against religious institutions, people, objects, or events. However, it is important to note that religious violence is not exclusively committed by religious groups; it also includes acts committed against religious groups.

The term "violence" in this context is broad and multifaceted. It can denote a wide range of experiences, from physical harm and bloodshed to the infringement of personal freedoms. It can also refer to passionate conduct or language, or intense emotions such as fury and passion. 

On the other hand, "religion" is a complex and problematic modern western concept. While there is no scholarly consensus on what constitutes a religion, it is generally considered an abstraction that includes beliefs, doctrines, and sacred places. The link between religious belief and behavior is complex and not always direct. People's religious ideas are often fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent, much like other domains of culture and life.

Religions, ethical systems, and societies rarely promote violence as an end in itself, as violence is universally undesirable. However, there is a universal tension between the general desire to avoid violence and the acceptance of justifiable uses of violence to prevent a "greater evil". This tension permeates all cultures and is often at the heart of religious violence.

In the context of this book, religious violence is understood as the manifestation of this tension, where religious beliefs, doctrines, or precepts are used to justify violent acts. It is a complex interplay of religious and political factors, where religion can be used as a tool to further political agendas, control populations, or gain power, often resulting in violent conflicts. 

Understanding religious violence requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the historical, political, and social contexts in which it occurs. It is not a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship, but rather a complex web of factors that can lead to violent outcomes. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these factors and explore the political origins of religious violence.

#### 4.1b Causes of Religious Violence

Religious violence, as we have defined it, is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes. It is important to understand that these causes are not exclusive to religion, but are often intertwined with political, social, and economic factors. In this section, we will explore some of the key causes of religious violence.

##### 4.1b.i Exclusivism and Superiority

One of the primary causes of religious violence is the belief in the superiority of one's own religion and the denigration of others. This is often rooted in religious exclusivism, the belief that one's own religion is the only true path to salvation or enlightenment, and all others are false or inferior. This belief can lead to intolerance, discrimination, and ultimately, violence against those who belong to other religions.

Hector Avalos argues that this sense of self-righteousness and superiority, based on unverifiable appeals to divine favor, can lead to violence because conflicting claims cannot be objectively adjudicated[^1^]. Regina Schwartz also argues that all monotheistic religions, including Christianity, are inherently violent because of their exclusivism which inevitably fosters violence against those who are considered outsiders[^2^].

##### 4.1b.ii Political Manipulation

Religion can also be manipulated for political purposes, leading to violence. Political leaders may use religious rhetoric to mobilize support, justify policies, or demonize opponents. This can lead to the politicization of religious identities, exacerbating tensions between different religious groups and leading to violence.

Eric Hickey writes that the history of religious violence in the West is as long as the historical record of its three major religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, with their mutual antagonisms and their struggles to adapt and survive despite the secular forces that threaten their continued existence[^3^]. This suggests that religious violence is often intertwined with political struggles for power and survival.

##### 4.1b.iii Doctrine of Holy War

The development of doctrines that justify violence in the name of religion can also lead to religious violence. For example, before the 11th century, Christians had not developed the doctrine of "Holy war", the belief that fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act[^4^]. The development of such doctrines can provide religious justification for violence, making it more likely to occur.

In conclusion, religious violence is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes. It is often intertwined with political, social, and economic factors, and is rooted in beliefs of religious superiority, political manipulation, and doctrines that justify violence. Understanding these causes is crucial for addressing and preventing religious violence.

#### 4.1c Effects of Religious Violence

Religious violence, as we have discussed, is a complex and multifaceted issue. It is not only the cause of numerous conflicts and wars throughout history, but it also has profound effects on societies, individuals, and the global community. In this section, we will explore some of the key effects of religious violence.

##### 4.1c.i Societal Disruption

Religious violence can lead to significant societal disruption. This can include the breakdown of social structures, the displacement of populations, and the destruction of cultural heritage. For example, the Crusades, a series of religious wars in the Middle Ages, led to significant societal disruption in the regions affected, including the displacement of populations and the destruction of cultural heritage[^4^].

##### 4.1c.ii Psychological Impact

Religious violence can also have a profound psychological impact on individuals. This can include trauma, fear, and a sense of insecurity. The psychological impact of religious violence can be long-lasting and can affect individuals' mental health, well-being, and quality of life[^5^].

##### 4.1c.iii Polarization and Radicalization

Religious violence can also lead to polarization and radicalization. This can occur when individuals or groups feel threatened or marginalized because of their religious beliefs. In response, they may become more radical in their beliefs and actions, leading to a cycle of violence and radicalization[^6^].

##### 4.1c.iv Global Impact

Finally, religious violence can have a global impact. This can include the spread of extremist ideologies, the destabilization of regions, and the exacerbation of global conflicts. For example, religious violence in the Middle East has had a significant impact on global security and has contributed to the global refugee crisis[^7^].

In conclusion, the effects of religious violence are far-reaching and profound. They affect not only the individuals and communities directly involved, but also the wider society and the global community. Understanding these effects is crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and mitigate religious violence.

### Section: 4.2 Political Factors in Religious Violence:

#### 4.2a State-Sponsored Religious Violence

State-sponsored religious violence is a form of religious violence where the state or government is either directly involved in, or indirectly supports, acts of violence against individuals or groups based on their religious beliefs[^8^]. This form of violence can be seen in various historical and contemporary contexts, and it often intersects with political ideologies and power dynamics.

One of the key political factors in state-sponsored religious violence is the concept of religious exclusivism, as argued by Regina Schwartz[^1^]. When a state aligns itself with a particular religion and adopts an exclusivist stance, it can lead to the marginalization, persecution, and even violence against those who do not adhere to the state-sanctioned religion. This can be seen in historical contexts such as the Crusades, where the doctrine of "Holy War" was developed and used to justify violence in the name of religion[^2^].

Another political factor is the use of religious violence as a tool for political control and power. This can be seen in the development of St. Augustine's "Just War" concept in the 4th century, which allowed for limited uses of war to preserve peace and retain orthodoxy[^3^]. This concept was used to justify state-sponsored violence in the name of religion, and it highlights the intersection of politics and religion in the context of religious violence.

State-sponsored religious violence can also be influenced by geopolitical factors. For example, religious violence can be used as a tool for territorial expansion, as seen in the Crusades[^4^]. Similarly, religious violence can be used to destabilize regions and exert political control, as seen in contemporary contexts in the Middle East[^7^].

In conclusion, state-sponsored religious violence is a complex issue that is influenced by a range of political factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for addressing and preventing religious violence in various contexts.

In the next section, we will explore the role of non-state actors in religious violence.

#### 4.2b Political Instability and Religious Violence

Political instability often serves as a catalyst for religious violence. In situations of political turmoil, religious differences can be exploited to fuel conflict and violence. This can be seen in numerous historical and contemporary contexts, and it highlights the complex relationship between politics and religion[^9^].

One of the key political factors in religious violence during periods of instability is the manipulation of religious identities for political gain. In situations of political instability, leaders may exploit religious differences to consolidate power, create divisions, and mobilize support[^10^]. This can be seen in the case of the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, where political leaders manipulated religious and ethnic identities to fuel conflict and violence[^11^].

Another factor is the breakdown of law and order during periods of political instability. This can create a power vacuum that religious groups may seek to fill, leading to conflict and violence. For example, the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria can be linked to the political instability and power vacuum created by the US-led invasion of Iraq and the Syrian Civil War[^12^].

Political instability can also lead to increased levels of religious violence due to the lack of effective conflict resolution mechanisms. In stable political systems, conflicts between different religious groups can often be managed and resolved through political and legal processes. However, in situations of political instability, these mechanisms may be weakened or absent, leading to an escalation of religious violence[^13^].

In conclusion, political instability can significantly contribute to religious violence. Understanding the political factors that drive religious violence during periods of instability is crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and mitigate such violence. This underscores the importance of exploring the intersection of politics and religion in the context of religious violence.

#### 4.2c Religion as a Tool for Political Power

Religion has often been used as a tool for political power, with leaders exploiting religious beliefs and identities to consolidate their rule and mobilize support[^14^]. This can be seen in the case of Emperor Julian, who attempted to bring paganism back to the forefront of Roman public and private life during his brief reign[^15^].

Julian's efforts to revive paganism were not merely a reflection of his personal beliefs, but also a political strategy. By promoting paganism, Julian sought to differentiate himself from his Christian predecessors and appeal to the still predominantly pagan population of the Roman Empire[^16^]. This strategy, however, was ultimately unsuccessful due to the internal divisions within paganism and the lack of a unified 'pagan religion'[^17^].

The use of religion as a tool for political power can also contribute to religious violence. When religious identities are manipulated for political gain, it can exacerbate religious tensions and lead to conflict and violence. This can be seen in the communal festivals during Julian's reign, which once united communities but now tore them apart—Christian against pagan[^18^].

Moreover, the seizure of sacred temple funds by Julian's uncle Constantine to support the Christian Church illustrates how religious institutions can be co-opted for political purposes. This not only led to the financial decline of pagan temples, but also further entrenched the dominance of Christianity in the Roman Empire[^19^].

In conclusion, the political use of religion can have profound implications for religious violence. Understanding the ways in which religion is used as a tool for political power is therefore crucial for exploring the intersection of politics and religion.

#### 4.3a Religious Violence in the Middle East

The Middle East, a region with a rich tapestry of religious diversity, has unfortunately been a hotbed of religious violence. This violence often stems from the intersection of politics and religion, where religious identities are manipulated for political gain, leading to heightened tensions and conflict[^20^]. A case in point is the 2017 Temple Mount shooting in Jerusalem, which was attributed to Jewish religious terrorism[^21^].

The Temple Mount, a site of significant religious importance to both Jews and Muslims, became the epicenter of violence and conflict following the shooting. The Israeli authorities' decision to shut down the complex and cancel Friday prayers at the al-Aqsa mosque for the first time in years was met with widespread protest[^21^]. The subsequent installation of metal detectors at the entrances to the compound, under protest from the site's Waqf authorities, further escalated the situation[^21^].

The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, called on Muslims to march to al-Aqsa and hold Friday prayers wherever they were stopped, leading to his detention by Israeli security officers[^21^]. This incident illustrates how religious leaders can become embroiled in political conflicts, further fueling religious tensions.

The crisis spiraled into a weeklong stand-off, with Israeli security agencies recommending the removal of the metal detectors. However, the Waqf called on Muslims to protest outside of the compound instead of entering, leading to clashes between Palestinians and Israeli authorities[^21^].

This case study underscores the complex interplay between politics and religion in the Middle East. The political decisions made in the aftermath of the Temple Mount shooting not only exacerbated religious tensions but also led to violence and conflict. It is a stark reminder of the potential for religious violence when political power is wielded without careful consideration of religious sensitivities.

In the next section, we will explore another case study of religious violence in a different context, highlighting the global nature of this issue.

#### 4.3b Religious Violence in South Asia

South Asia, particularly India, has a long history of religious diversity and coexistence. However, the region has also witnessed numerous instances of religious violence, often fueled by political motivations and power struggles[^22^]. This section will explore some of the major incidents of religious violence in India, focusing on violence against Christians and the aftermath of the Partition of India.

##### Violence against Christians in India

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, India saw a surge in violence against Christians. The 1998 attacks on Christians in southeastern Gujarat, for instance, resulted in more than 20 incidents of churches being burnt down and damaged in and around the Dang District[^23^]. The Human Rights Watch reported assaults against Christians, damages and burning down of Churches and Christian institutions in at least 25 villages all over Gujarat from 25 December 1998 to the next ten days[^23^].

In 1999, the village of Ranalai in Gajapati district of Orissa was the site of violent clashes after a dispute over the addition of religious symbols in the Khamani Hill of the village[^24^]. A crowd of 2000 people, reportedly followers of the Sangh Parivar, armed with country made guns and weapons, completely burned down 157 Christian houses and looted the remaining Christian houses in the village[^24^]. The National Commission for Minorities (NCM) blamed the BJP for the violence[^24^].

The 2007 Christmas violence in Kandhamal was another significant incident where more than 100 Churches and Christian Institutions were burnt down or vandalized[^25^]. The violence was reportedly instigated by the Sangh-affiliated Kui Samaj together with the groups led by Sangh Parivar organizations[^25^].

These incidents illustrate how religious violence can be triggered by political motivations and power struggles, often leading to the persecution of religious minorities.

##### Partition of India

The Partition of India in 1947, which led to the creation of a separate Islamic state of Pakistan for Muslims, resulted in large scale sectarian strife and bloodshed throughout the nation[^26^]. The partition, which was primarily a political decision, had profound religious implications, leading to one of the largest mass migrations in human history and causing immense human suffering[^26^].

These case studies underscore the complex interplay between politics and religion in South Asia. They highlight how political decisions can exacerbate religious tensions and lead to violence, underscoring the need for careful consideration of religious sensitivities in political decision-making.

#### 4.3c Religious Violence in Africa

Africa, particularly Nigeria, has a long history of religious diversity and coexistence. However, the region has also witnessed numerous instances of religious violence, often fueled by political motivations and power struggles[^26^]. This section will explore some of the major incidents of religious violence in Nigeria, focusing on the conflicts between Christians and Muslims.

##### Religious Conflict in Nigeria

Religious conflict in Nigeria dates back to as early as 1953, with the town of Tafawa Balewa experiencing religious violence since 1948[^27^]. The 1980s saw an upsurge in violence due to the death of Mohammed Marwa ("Maitatsine")[^27^]. In the same decade, the military ruler of Nigeria, General Ibrahim Babangida, enrolled Nigeria in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, a move which aggravated religious tensions in the country, particularly among the Christian community[^27^].

In response to this, some in the Muslim community pointed out that certain other African member states have smaller proportions of Muslims, as well as Nigeria's diplomatic relations with the Holy See[^27^]. Since the return of democracy to Nigeria in 1999, Sharia was instituted as a main body of civil and criminal law in 9 Muslim-majority and in some parts of 3 Muslim-plurality states[^27^].

##### 1980s Religious Violence in Nigeria

In the 1980s, a serious outbreak between Christians and Muslims occurred in Kafanchan in southern Kaduna State in a border area between the two religions[^27^]. This was propagated by extreme leaders who were able to rally a young, educated group of individuals who feared that the nation would not be able to protect their religious group[^27^]. The leaders were able to polarize their followers through speeches and public demonstrations[^27^].

The activities during this time led to the loss of lives and properties as they moved about destroying government facilities which they saw as legacies or replicas of western cultures in their various communities[^27^]. These religious campaigns have seen an increase in gun battles between the members of these sects and security forces with loss of lives witnessed on both sides[^27^]. Although direct conflicts between Christians and Muslims were rare, tensions did flare between the two groups as each group radicalised[^27^]. There were clashes in October 1982[^27^].

These incidents illustrate how religious violence can be triggered by political motivations and power struggles, often leading to the persecution of religious minorities. The case of Nigeria provides a clear example of how politics and religion can intersect to create a volatile environment, leading to violence and conflict. 

In the next section, we will explore religious violence in the Middle East, focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the complex and often contentious intersection of politics and religion, specifically focusing on the political origins of religious violence. We have explored how political power dynamics, territorial disputes, and ideological differences can ignite religious tensions and lead to violence. We have also examined how religious violence can be used as a political tool to consolidate power, suppress dissent, and further political agendas.

We have seen that religious violence is not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a complex interplay of political, social, and cultural factors. It is not solely a product of religious beliefs or doctrines, but rather a manifestation of underlying political and social conflicts. This understanding is crucial in formulating effective strategies to prevent and mitigate religious violence.

However, it is also important to note that religion and politics can also intersect in positive ways, fostering social cohesion, promoting peace, and facilitating dialogue and understanding. The challenge lies in harnessing these positive aspects while mitigating the potential for conflict and violence.

Critically analyze the statement: "Religious violence is not solely a product of religious beliefs or doctrines, but rather a manifestation of underlying political and social conflicts." Provide examples to support your analysis.

#### Exercise 5
Propose strategies to prevent and mitigate religious violence. How can these strategies address the political origins of religious violence?

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Continuity and Change in Church-State Relations

### Introduction

The relationship between church and state has been a topic of intense debate and scrutiny throughout history. This chapter, "Continuity and Change in Church-State Relations," aims to delve into the intricate dynamics of this relationship, exploring its evolution and the factors that have influenced its continuity and change over time.

The church-state relationship is a complex one, often characterized by a delicate balance of power, influence, and mutual respect. It is a relationship that has shaped societies, influenced laws, and played a significant role in the political landscape of many nations. This chapter will explore the historical context of this relationship, examining how it has evolved over time and the factors that have contributed to its continuity and change.

We will delve into the various models of church-state relations that have been prevalent in different societies, from theocracy to secularism, and how these models have influenced the political and religious landscape of these societies. We will also examine the role of religion in politics, and how the intertwining of these two spheres has affected governance and policy-making.

This chapter will also explore the impact of societal changes on church-state relations. How have shifts in societal values, technological advancements, and changes in political ideologies influenced the relationship between church and state? What role does religion play in the modern political landscape, and how has this role evolved over time?

In exploring these questions, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the continuity and change in church-state relations, shedding light on the complex dynamics of this relationship and its impact on society. This chapter will not only provide historical context but also stimulate thought and discussion on the future of church-state relations in an increasingly global and diverse world. 

Join us as we navigate the intricate intersection of politics and religion, exploring the continuity and change in church-state relations.

### Section: 5.1 Classical Theories of Secularization:

#### Subsection: 5.1a Weber's Theory of Secicularization

Max Weber, a renowned sociologist, made significant contributions to the understanding of religion and its intersection with politics. His theories on secularization provide a unique perspective on the evolution of church-state relations.

Weber's theory of secularization is rooted in his broader rationalization thesis, which posits that the modern world is increasingly characterized by the dominance of goal-oriented rationality, or Zweckrationalität. This form of rationality, Weber argues, is displacing traditional, value-oriented forms of action, or Wertrationalität, which are often grounded in religious beliefs.

Weber's approach to understanding religion is characterized by his use of "Verstehen," a method of interpretation that seeks to understand the intention and context of human action. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of religion, as Weber argues that religious action should be understood on its own terms. He posits that religion shapes an individual's worldview, influencing their interests and actions.

In Weber's view, religion responds to the human need for theodicy and soteriology. Theodicy refers to the question of how the power of a divine god can be reconciled with the imperfections of the world, while soteriology refers to the pursuit of salvation. Weber argues that religion provides answers to these existential questions, thereby influencing human motivation.

Weber's theory of secularization suggests that as societies become more rational and less traditional, the influence of religion on politics and society at large may diminish. However, Weber also acknowledges the enduring influence of religion, noting that religious beliefs and practices can adapt to changing societal conditions.

Weber's theory provides a useful framework for understanding the continuity and change in church-state relations. It suggests that while the influence of religion may change over time, it remains a significant factor in shaping political and social dynamics. This perspective is particularly relevant in the context of modern societies, where the relationship between church and state continues to evolve in response to changing societal values, technological advancements, and shifts in political ideologies.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into Weber's theory of secularization and its implications for church-state relations, exploring how this theory can help us understand the complex dynamics of this relationship in different societal contexts.

#### Subsection: 5.1b Durkheim's Theory of Secularization

Émile Durkheim, another influential sociologist, also contributed significantly to the understanding of religion and its intersection with politics. His theories on secularization provide a contrasting perspective to Weber's, focusing on the social functions of religion and its role in maintaining social cohesion.

Durkheim's theory of secularization is rooted in his concept of the "sacred-profane dichotomy". He posits that all societies distinguish between the sacred, which is set apart and revered, and the profane, which is ordinary and mundane. Religion, according to Durkheim, is a system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things, which unite individuals into a moral community.

Durkheim's approach to understanding religion is characterized by his focus on its social functions. He argues that religion serves to reinforce social norms and values, promote social cohesion, and provide a sense of collective identity. This perspective is often referred to as "functionalism".

In Durkheim's view, religion responds to the human need for social order and moral regulation. He argues that religious rituals and ceremonies serve to reinforce social bonds and shared values, thereby contributing to social stability.

Durkheim's theory of secularization suggests that as societies become more complex and differentiated, the role of religion in maintaining social cohesion may diminish. However, Durkheim also acknowledges the enduring social functions of religion, noting that other social institutions may take on these functions as societies evolve.

Durkheim's theory provides a useful framework for understanding the continuity and change in church-state relations. It suggests that the role of religion in politics and society is not merely a product of individual beliefs and motivations, but also of broader social structures and processes. This perspective can help us understand the "neo-Durkheimian embedding of religion in a state" and the "close interweaving of religion, life-style and patriotism" mentioned in the related context.

In the context of the "Age of Authenticity", Durkheim's theory would suggest that while the traditional forms of religious practice may decline, the social functions of religion may persist in other forms. This could include the pursuit of "spirituality" as opposed to "organized religion", and the development of a "religious life" that extends beyond ordinary church practice. 

In conclusion, Durkheim's theory of secularization provides a valuable lens through which to examine the evolving relationship between religion and politics. It highlights the social functions of religion and the ways in which these functions may adapt and persist in a changing societal context.

#### Subsection: 5.1c Marx's Theory of Secularization

Karl Marx, a prominent philosopher and economist, offered a unique perspective on the intersection of religion and politics. His theory of secularization is rooted in his critique of religion as a tool of social control and his vision of a society free from religious influence.

Marx's theory of secularization is fundamentally tied to his critique of capitalism. He argued that religion, like the state, is a part of the superstructure that arises from the economic base of society. In his view, religion is a reflection of the material conditions of society and serves to legitimize the economic and social inequalities inherent in capitalism.

In his work "A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right", Marx famously described religion as the "opium of the people". He argued that religion provides an emotional escape from the harsh realities of the world, offering solace and consolation to the oppressed. However, Marx also saw religion as a form of social control, used by the ruling classes to justify their exploitation of the working classes.

Marx's theory of secularization is characterized by his call for the removal of religious influence from the law, social norms, and traditions. He believed that the social authority of theology must be removed from society to allow for true political emancipation. This perspective is often referred to as "Marxist–Leninist atheism".

Marx's theory suggests that as societies evolve and become more secular, the influence of religion on politics and society will diminish. However, Marx also acknowledged the enduring social functions of religion, noting that other social institutions may take on these functions as societies evolve.

Marx's theory provides a useful framework for understanding the continuity and change in church-state relations. It suggests that the role of religion in politics and society is not merely a product of individual beliefs and motivations, but also of broader social structures and processes. This perspective can help us understand the complex interplay between religion and politics in contemporary societies.

In conclusion, Marx's theory of secularization offers a critical perspective on the role of religion in society. It challenges us to consider the ways in which religion can serve as both a source of comfort and a tool of social control, and to reflect on the potential for a society free from religious influence.

#### Subsection: 5.2a Postmodern Critiques

Postmodernism, a philosophical movement that emerged in the mid-20th century, has been a significant challenge to classical theories of religion and politics. Postmodernists reject the grand narratives and ideologies that have traditionally shaped our understanding of the world, including those of religion and politics. They argue that these narratives are not universally valid, but are instead constructed and shaped by power relations.

However, postmodernism has been subject to numerous criticisms, particularly from Marxian perspectives. Alex Callinicos, for instance, criticizes postmodern thinkers like Baudrillard and Lyotard, arguing that postmodernism reflects the political frustration and social mobility of the 'new middle class' rather than being a significant intellectual or cultural phenomenon in its own right[^1^].

Fredric Jameson, another Marxist critic, attacks postmodernism for its refusal to critically engage with the metanarratives of capitalization and globalization. He argues that this refusal makes postmodernist philosophy complicit with the prevailing relations of domination and exploitation[^2^].

Postmodernism has also been criticized for its perceived incompatibility with individual freedom. Michael Rectenwald argues that postmodernism denies self-determination and individual agency by viewing the individual as a mere product of language and social factors[^3^]. This perspective, he argues, leads to a cultural obsession with social identity that further denies individual agency.

These criticisms highlight the challenges that postmodernism poses to classical theories of religion and politics. They suggest that while postmodernism offers a valuable critique of grand narratives and ideologies, it may also undermine the possibility of individual agency and political emancipation.

In the context of church-state relations, postmodern critiques can be seen as a challenge to the idea of a clear and stable boundary between the religious and the political. They suggest that this boundary is not a given, but is instead constructed and contested in specific historical and cultural contexts. This perspective can provide a valuable tool for analyzing the complexities and contradictions of church-state relations in the contemporary world.

#### Subsection: 5.2b Feminist Critiques

Feminist critiques of classical theories of religion and politics have been instrumental in challenging the patriarchal biases inherent in these fields. These critiques have been diverse, encompassing a range of perspectives from Black feminism, feminist existentialism, and ecofeminism.

Black feminism, for instance, has critiqued the intersection of race and gender in the political and religious spheres. Critics argue that divisions along the lines of race or gender weaken the strength of the overall feminist and anti-racist movements[^4^]. This critique challenges the classical theories that often overlook the intersectionality of identities in their analysis.

Feminist existentialism, as exemplified by Simone de Beauvoir, has also offered significant critiques. Beauvoir's work has been critiqued for its inconsistency and inability to transfer theory into praxis[^5^]. However, the field has also been instrumental in extending the critique to sexism within existentialism itself[^6^]. This critique challenges the classical theories' often uncritical acceptance of sexist views.

Ecofeminism, a movement that emerged in the late 20th century, has critiqued the patriarchal dominance and norms that are often reinforced in classical theories of religion and politics[^7^]. Critics of ecofeminism have accused it of essentialism, arguing that it reinforces patriarchal dominance rather than challenging it[^8^].

In the context of church-state relations, these feminist critiques challenge the classical theories' often uncritical acceptance of patriarchal norms and biases. They argue for a more nuanced understanding of religion and politics that takes into account the intersectionality of identities and the patriarchal structures that often shape these fields.

These feminist critiques, like the postmodern critiques discussed earlier, highlight the need for a critical reevaluation of classical theories of religion and politics. They suggest that these theories need to be more inclusive and sensitive to the diverse experiences and identities that shape our understanding of the world.

#### Subsection: 5.2c Postcolonial Critiques

Postcolonial critiques of classical theories of religion and politics have been instrumental in challenging the Eurocentric biases inherent in these fields. These critiques have been diverse, encompassing a range of perspectives from postcolonial theory, subaltern studies, and decolonial thought.

Postcolonial theory, as exemplified by Edward Said's Orientalism[^9^], has critiqued the Eurocentric biases in the political and religious spheres. Said's work has been instrumental in challenging the classical theories that often overlook the power dynamics between the colonizer and the colonized in their analysis[^10^].

Subaltern studies, a field that emerged in the late 20th century, has critiqued the marginalization of the voices of the colonized in classical theories of religion and politics[^11^]. Critics of subaltern studies have accused it of essentialism, arguing that it reinforces colonial power structures rather than challenging them[^12^].

Decolonial thought, as exemplified by the works of Frantz Fanon and Aimé Césaire, has critiqued the lingering effects of colonialism in the political and religious spheres[^13^]. Critics argue that divisions along the lines of race or ethnicity weaken the strength of the overall anti-colonial movements[^14^]. This critique challenges the classical theories that often overlook the intersectionality of identities in their analysis.

In the context of church-state relations, these postcolonial critiques challenge the classical theories' often uncritical acceptance of Eurocentric norms and biases. They argue for a more nuanced understanding of religion and politics that takes into account the power dynamics between the colonizer and the colonized and the intersectionality of identities.

These postcolonial critiques, like the feminist and postmodern critiques discussed earlier, highlight the need for a critical reevaluation of classical theories of religion and politics. They suggest that these theories often fail to account for the complexities of postcolonial societies and the lingering effects of colonialism.

#### Subsection: 5.3a The Secular State Model

The secular state model is one of the emerging models of church-state relations. In this model, the state does not endorse any particular religion, but instead maintains a neutral stance towards all religions. This neutrality is often enshrined in the constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits the establishment of a state religion[^15^].

The secular state model is not without its complexities and challenges. For instance, while the state may not officially endorse a religion, certain religions may still hold a privileged position in society due to historical, cultural, or demographic reasons. This can lead to tensions between different religious groups, as well as between religious and non-religious individuals[^16^].

The secular state model can be seen in countries such as the United States, France, and India. In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the establishment of a state religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion[^17^]. In France, the principle of laïcité, or secularism, is a cornerstone of the French Republic, and is enshrined in the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State[^18^]. In India, the Constitution declares India to be a "sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic" and guarantees freedom of religion[^19^].

However, the implementation of secularism varies widely across these countries. In the United States, for example, the "wall of separation" between church and state is interpreted to mean that the government cannot promote or favor any particular religion, but can accommodate religious practices as long as it does not coerce participation[^20^]. In France, on the other hand, laïcité is interpreted more strictly, with the state maintaining a strict neutrality towards religion and prohibiting public displays of religious symbols in certain contexts[^21^].

In the context of the postcolonial critiques discussed in the previous section, the secular state model can be seen as a response to the Eurocentric biases inherent in classical theories of religion and politics. By maintaining a neutral stance towards all religions, the secular state model seeks to avoid privileging any particular religious tradition, thereby challenging the Eurocentric norms and biases that often underpin classical theories of religion and politics[^22^].

However, critics argue that the secular state model, like the classical theories it seeks to challenge, often overlooks the power dynamics between different religious groups and the intersectionality of identities. They argue that a truly inclusive and equitable model of church-state relations must take into account these complexities[^23^].

#### Subsection: 5.3b The Theocratic State Model

The theocratic state model represents another emerging model of church-state relations. In this model, the state is governed by immediate divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided. The laws of the state are based on religious law, and the state's leaders are members of the clergy. The state's legal system is intertwined with the religion and the state claims to be governed by divine guidance[^22^].

Iran is a prime example of a theocratic state. Described as a "theocratic republic" by the CIA World Factbook, Iran's constitution is a blend of "theocratic and democratic elements"[^23^]. All aspects of law, including civil, penal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and others, are based on Islamic criteria[^24^].

In Iran, the head of state, or "Supreme Leader", is a "faqih" (scholar of Islamic law) and holds more power than the president. The Supreme Leader appoints the heads of many powerful governmental positions, including the commanders of the armed forces, the director of the national radio and television network, the heads of major religious and economic foundations, the chief justice of Iran, the attorney general, special tribunals, and members of the supreme national security council dealing with defense and foreign affairs[^25^].

The Supreme Leader is elected by the Assembly of Experts, which is composed of mujtahids, Islamic scholars competent in interpreting "Sharia" or Islamic law[^26^]. The Guardian Council, another powerful body in Iran, has the power to reject bills passed by the Parliament and approve or reject candidates who want to run for the Presidency, Parliament, and the Assembly of Experts[^27^].

The theocratic state model, as seen in Iran, presents its own unique set of challenges and complexities. While it ensures a high degree of religious homogeneity and can foster a strong sense of national identity, it can also lead to the suppression of religious minorities and limit individual freedoms[^28^]. Furthermore, the intertwining of religion and state can make it difficult to enact reforms or changes that go against established religious doctrines[^29^].

In the next section, we will explore the model of the established church, as seen in countries like England and Denmark.

#### Subsection: 5.3c The Pluralist State Model

The pluralist state model represents a different approach to church-state relations, one that is characterized by a high degree of religious diversity and a state that is neutral towards all religions[^28^]. In this model, the state does not endorse any particular religion, but rather provides a framework within which multiple religions can coexist and compete for followers[^29^]. This model is often associated with democratic societies that value freedom of religion and the separation of church and state[^30^].

The United States is often cited as an example of a pluralist state. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits the establishment of a national religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion[^31^]. This has resulted in a diverse religious landscape, with numerous religious groups coexisting and competing for followers. The U.S. government does not endorse any particular religion, but rather provides a framework within which all religions can operate freely[^32^].

The pluralist state model has its own set of challenges and complexities. On one hand, it can foster a high degree of religious diversity and freedom, allowing individuals to choose their own religious beliefs and practices[^33^]. On the other hand, it can also lead to religious conflict and tension, as different religious groups compete for followers and influence[^34^].

The pluralist state model also raises questions about the role of religion in public life. In a pluralist state, should religious groups be allowed to influence public policy? If so, how should the state manage the competing interests of different religious groups? These are complex questions that continue to be debated in pluralist societies[^35^].

In conclusion, the pluralist state model represents a unique approach to church-state relations, one that values religious diversity and freedom. However, like all models, it has its own set of challenges and complexities, and its success depends on a variety of factors, including the specific religious and cultural context of the society in question[^36^].

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex and dynamic relationship between politics and religion, specifically focusing on the continuity and change in church-state relations. We have seen that the relationship between church and state is not static, but rather evolves over time, influenced by a myriad of factors including societal changes, political shifts, and theological developments. 

We have also examined how the intersection of politics and religion can both unite and divide communities, and how it can be a source of both conflict and cooperation. The church-state relationship is a delicate balance, requiring careful navigation to ensure the protection of religious freedom, the maintenance of political stability, and the promotion of social harmony.

In conclusion, the study of the intersection between politics and religion, particularly in the context of church-state relations, is a rich and complex field. It is a subject that demands a nuanced understanding of both religious and political systems, as well as a keen awareness of historical and contemporary contexts. As we move forward, it is crucial to continue exploring this intersection, as it holds significant implications for our understanding of society, politics, and religion.

## Chapter: Modernization, Seciculization, and Social Change

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the complex and often contentious relationship between modernization, secularization, and social change, particularly in the context of politics and religion. The process of modernization, characterized by the transition from traditional, rural, agrarian societies to modern, urban, industrial ones, has profound implications for both politics and religion. It is often accompanied by secularization, a process that involves the declining influence of religion in public life.

The intersection of these processes with politics and religion is multifaceted and dynamic. On one hand, modernization and secularization can lead to the marginalization of religion in the public sphere, as seen in many Western societies. On the other hand, in some contexts, these processes can also lead to a resurgence of religious influence in politics, as a response to the uncertainties and dislocations associated with rapid social change.

This chapter will explore these complex dynamics, drawing on a range of theoretical perspectives and empirical examples. We will examine how modernization and secularization shape political institutions and ideologies, and how they interact with religious beliefs and practices. We will also consider how these processes are shaped by broader social changes, including shifts in economic structures, technological innovations, and cultural transformations.

In doing so, we aim to shed light on the intricate ways in which politics and religion intersect in the contemporary world, and how they are shaped by, and in turn shape, processes of modernization, secularization, and social change. This exploration will not only deepen our understanding of these processes, but also provide insights into some of the most pressing political and religious challenges of our time.

### Section: 6.1 Theories of Modernization and Seciculization:

#### 6.1a Modernization Theory

Modernization theory is a model of sociocultural evolution that emerged in the mid-20th century, building on earlier ideas about progress and development. It posits that societies transition from traditional, agrarian structures to modern, industrial ones, and that this process is both desirable and achievable. The theory is closely tied to the experiences and empirical research of the era of decolonization, and it has been influential in shaping development policies and practices.

The theory of modernization is underpinned by several key assumptions. First, it assumes that all societies can, and should, follow the path of modernization. This is based on the idea that modern societies are more successful, in terms of economic growth and social well-being, than traditional ones. Second, it assumes that modernization is a linear process, with societies progressing through a series of stages towards modernity. This is often referred to as the Rostovian take-off model, named after Walt Rostow, one of the key contributors to modernization theory.

Rostow's "The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto" (1960) is a seminal work in modernization theory. He proposed a five-stage model of economic development, starting with the traditional society and progressing through preconditions for take-off, take-off, drive to maturity, and finally, the age of high mass consumption. According to Rostow, each stage is characterized by specific economic structures and processes, and societies must meet certain conditions to progress to the next stage.

David Apter, another key figure in modernization theory, focused on the political aspects of modernization. He explored the relationship between democracy, good governance, and modernization, arguing that democratic institutions and practices are both a prerequisite for and an outcome of modernization.

Modernization theory has been both influential and controversial. Its proponents argue that it provides a roadmap for development and progress, while its critics contend that it is ethnocentric, assuming that Western societies are the model for all others to follow. Despite these criticisms, modernization theory continues to shape our understanding of social change, and it provides a useful framework for exploring the intersection of politics and religion in the modern world.

#### 6.1b Secularization as a Result of Modernization

Secularization theory, a counterpart to modernization theory, posits that as societies modernize, they become more secular. This theory is rooted in the Enlightenment belief that as societies progress, they will inevitably move away from religious beliefs and practices, and towards rationality, science, and technology. The secularization thesis, as it is often called, has been a dominant paradigm in the sociology of religion since the 19th century, with key proponents such as Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, and Karl Marx.

Weber, one of the founding figures of sociology, proposed the idea of "disenchantment of the world," arguing that modernization, characterized by rationalization and bureaucratization, would lead to a decline in the influence of religion. He saw this process as a shift from a world imbued with sacred meanings and populated by spirits and gods, to a disenchanted world dominated by human mastery and rational calculation[^1^].

Durkheim, on the other hand, saw secularization not as the decline of religion, but as a transformation of the sacred. In his view, as societies modernize, the sacred is not eliminated but rather relocated. The sacred, once embodied in religious symbols and rituals, is now found in the collective ideals and values that bind modern societies together[^2^].

Marx, in his critique of religion, saw it as an "opium of the people," a tool used by the ruling classes to maintain social inequality. He predicted that as societies modernize and move towards a classless society, the need for religion would disappear[^3^].

However, the secularization thesis has been challenged on several fronts. In his book "A Secular Age," Charles Taylor rejects the "subtraction" theory of secularization, arguing that secularization is not simply the removal of religion from society, but a complex process involving social, cultural, and intellectual changes[^4^]. He suggests that modernization has led to a shift in the conditions of belief, creating a new, secular age characterized by a plurality of religious and non-religious options.

In conclusion, while the theories of modernization and secularization provide valuable insights into the relationship between social change and religion, they also highlight the complexity and diversity of this relationship. As societies continue to modernize, the role and place of religion remain dynamic and contested.

#### 6.1c Critiques of Modernization Theory

Modernization theory, despite its widespread acceptance and influence, has been subject to numerous criticisms. One of the most significant critiques is its ethnocentric bias, which is rooted in the theory's origins in Western societies. Critics argue that modernization theory tends to view Western societies as the standard of modernity, thereby marginalizing and devaluing non-Western cultures[^5^].

Andre Gunder Frank and Immanuel Wallerstein, among others, have criticized the theory for its assumption that modernization necessitates the destruction of indigenous cultures and their replacement with Western ones[^6^]. This perspective, they argue, is not only ethnocentric but also fails to recognize the potential for modernity to exist independently of Western culture. Japan, for instance, is often cited as an example of a non-Western society that has successfully modernized without fully adopting Western cultural norms[^7^].

Another critique of modernization theory is its conflation of modernization with other processes such as democratization, liberalization, and development. This conflation, as Tipps has argued, renders the term imprecise and difficult to disprove[^8^]. It also obscures the complex and multifaceted nature of societal change, reducing it to a binary of traditional versus modern.

Modernization theory has also been criticized for its failure to account for external sources of societal change. This oversight, critics argue, results in an overly simplistic and deterministic view of societal development that neglects the influence of factors such as global economic forces, technological advancements, and geopolitical dynamics[^9^].

Finally, the theory's Eurocentric bias is evident in its historical narrative, which positions modernization as a process that began in Europe with events such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. This narrative, critics argue, overlooks the diverse and complex histories of non-European societies and their unique paths to modernity[^10^].

In conclusion, while modernization theory has provided valuable insights into the processes of societal change, its limitations and biases necessitate a more nuanced and inclusive approach to understanding modernity.

#### 6.2a Dependency Theory

Dependency theory emerged as a counterpoint to modernization theory, offering a different perspective on the process of societal change and development. This theory, primarily associated with scholars from Latin America such as Raul Prebisch and Andre Gunder Frank, posits that the economic growth of the developed countries often occurs at the expense of the developing ones[^10^].

Dependency theorists argue that the global economic system is structured in such a way that wealth and resources flow from the periphery (poor countries) to the core (rich countries). This structure, they contend, perpetuates a state of dependency and underdevelopment in the periphery[^11^].

This perspective challenges the modernization theory's assumption that all societies follow a linear path of development, from traditional to modern. Instead, dependency theory suggests that the relationship between developed and developing countries is not merely one of lagging behind, but of active exploitation and suppression[^12^].

Dependency theory also critiques the modernization theory's emphasis on internal factors as the primary drivers of societal change. It argues that external factors, particularly the global economic system and the relationships between countries, play a significant role in shaping the development trajectories of societies[^13^].

However, dependency theory has its own set of criticisms. Some argue that it overemphasizes the role of external factors and neglects the importance of internal dynamics in shaping societal change[^14^]. Others contend that it presents an overly deterministic view of development, suggesting that poor countries are doomed to remain poor due to their position in the global economic system[^15^].

Despite these criticisms, dependency theory has significantly contributed to our understanding of societal change and development. It has highlighted the importance of considering the global context and the relationships between countries when studying these processes.

#### 6.2b World Systems Theory

World Systems Theory, developed by sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein, offers another critique of modernization theory[^16^]. This theory posits that the world is a complex system that is divided into a hierarchy of regions, each playing a different role in the global economy[^17^].

According to World Systems Theory, the global economy is divided into three types of regions: core, semi-periphery, and periphery[^18^]. Core regions, which are typically developed countries, dominate the global economy and exploit the other regions. Semi-periphery regions, which are in the process of industrializing, serve as a buffer between the core and periphery. Periphery regions, which are typically developing countries, provide raw materials and labor to the core and semi-periphery[^19^].

This theory challenges the modernization theory's assumption that all societies can achieve development through the same path. Instead, World Systems Theory suggests that the global economic system is structured in such a way that some regions are destined to remain underdeveloped[^20^].

World Systems Theory also critiques the modernization theory's emphasis on internal factors as the primary drivers of societal change. It argues that the global economic system and the relationships between regions play a significant role in shaping the development trajectories of societies[^21^].

However, World Systems Theory has its own set of criticisms. Some argue that it overemphasizes the role of economic factors and neglects the importance of political and cultural factors in shaping societal change[^22^]. Others contend that it presents an overly deterministic view of development, suggesting that poor regions are doomed to remain poor due to their position in the global economic system[^23^].

Despite these criticisms, World Systems Theory has significantly contributed to our understanding of societal change and development. It has highlighted the importance of considering the global context and the relationships between regions when studying societal change[^24^].

#### 6.2c Postmodern Critiques

Postmodernism, a movement that emerged in the mid-20th century, is characterized by a skepticism towards grand theories and ideologies, as well as a focus on the role of ideology, language, and power in shaping our understanding of reality[^24^]. Postmodern theorists have offered a number of critiques of modernization theory.

One of the key postmodern critiques of modernization theory is its rejection of grand narratives or metanarratives. Modernization theory, with its narrative of progress and development, is seen by postmodernists as a grand narrative that attempts to impose a single, universal model of development on diverse societies[^25^]. Postmodernists argue that this approach neglects the complexity and diversity of human societies and experiences[^26^].

Postmodernists also critique the modernization theory's emphasis on rationality and science. They argue that this emphasis reflects a Western-centric worldview that privileges Western forms of knowledge and marginalizes other forms of knowledge[^27^]. This critique aligns with postmodernism's broader challenge to the Enlightenment ideals of objectivity, rationality, and progress[^28^].

However, postmodernism itself has been subject to numerous criticisms. Marxian critics, for instance, argue that postmodernism reflects the political frustration and social mobility of the 'new middle class' rather than offering a significant intellectual or cultural critique[^29^]. American literary critic Fredric Jameson criticizes postmodernism for its refusal to critically engage with the metanarratives of capitalization and globalization[^30^].

Others, like Michael Rectenwald, argue that postmodernism is incompatible with individual freedom, as it sees the individual as a mere product of social constructs and denies individual agency[^31^]. This critique suggests that postmodernism's focus on social constructs and power relations can lead to a neglect of individual agency and self-determination[^32^].

Despite these criticisms, postmodern critiques have significantly contributed to our understanding of societal change and development. They have highlighted the importance of considering the role of ideology, language, and power in shaping our understanding of reality, and have challenged the assumptions and biases of modernization theory[^33^].

### Section: 6.3 Contemporary Challenges to Secularization:

#### 6.3a Religious Revivalism

Religious revivalism, as a contemporary challenge to secularization, is a phenomenon that has been observed in various societies and cultures across the globe. It is characterized by a resurgence of religious beliefs, practices, and institutions, often in response to perceived threats to religious identity or values[^32^]. This resurgence can take various forms, from the revival of traditional religious practices to the emergence of new religious movements[^33^].

The revival of 1800, also known as the Second Great Awakening in the United States, provides a historical example of religious revivalism. This revival was characterized by a wave of religious enthusiasm that swept across the American frontier, leading to a significant increase in church membership and the formation of new religious movements[^34^]. The revival meetings, as described by McGready, were characterized by a high level of emotional intensity and a focus on personal conversion[^35^].

The revival meetings were not only religious events but also social gatherings that attracted people from a wide geographical area. They served as a platform for the dissemination of religious ideas and practices, as well as a catalyst for social change[^36^]. The revival of 1800 had a significant impact on American society, influencing various aspects of social and cultural life, from politics and education to social reform movements[^37^].

In the contemporary context, religious revivalism can be seen as a response to the processes of modernization and secularization. As societies become more secular and diverse, religious communities may feel threatened and respond by reaffirming their religious identity and values[^38^]. This can lead to a resurgence of religious beliefs and practices, as well as the formation of new religious movements[^39^].

However, religious revivalism can also pose challenges to social cohesion and stability. It can lead to increased religious polarization and conflict, as different religious communities compete for followers and influence[^40^]. Furthermore, religious revivalism can challenge the secular norms and values of modern societies, leading to tensions between religious and secular communities[^41^].

In conclusion, religious revivalism represents a significant challenge to secularization. It reflects the enduring power of religion in shaping social and cultural life, even in the face of modernization and secularization. However, it also poses challenges to social cohesion and stability, highlighting the complex and often contentious relationship between religion and politics[^42^].

#### 6.3b Fundamentalism

Fundamentalism, as a contemporary challenge to secularization, is a phenomenon that is characterized by a strict adherence to specific theological doctrines usually in reaction against the theology of more modern social or political movements[^40^]. This strict interpretation of religious texts often leads to a rejection of modern interpretations and understandings of the world[^41^].

One of the most prominent examples of religious fundamentalism in the contemporary context is Mormon fundamentalism. Mormon fundamentalists, unlike mainstream Mormons, continue to practice polygamy, a practice that was officially discontinued by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1890[^42^].

The majority of Mormon fundamentalists belong to sects that have separated themselves from the LDS Church. These sects, often referred to as "Brighamite" sects, include the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) and the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church)[^43^].

The AUB, with an estimated membership of 5000 to 10000 members, is perhaps the largest Mormon fundamentalist group[^44^]. The AUB is one of the more liberal of the Mormon groups practicing plural marriage, with leaders not arranging marriages nor authorizing plural marriages for people under 18 or for those who are closely related[^45^].

The FLDS Church, on the other hand, is estimated to consist of 6000 members and has been embroiled in a succession crisis since 2002[^46^]. The members of the FLDS Church tend to be very conservative in dress and lifestyle[^47^].

These fundamentalist groups pose a challenge to secularization as they reject modern interpretations of religious texts and adhere strictly to traditional practices. This can lead to conflicts with secular laws and norms, as seen in the case of the FLDS Church and its practice of polygamy[^48^].

However, it is important to note that fundamentalism is not limited to religion. There are also political and social forms of fundamentalism, where individuals or groups adhere strictly to a set of beliefs or ideologies and reject modern interpretations or changes[^49^]. This can lead to conflicts and tensions within societies, as these fundamentalist views can often be at odds with more progressive or liberal views[^50^].

In conclusion, fundamentalism, whether religious or otherwise, poses a significant challenge to secularization. It represents a rejection of modern interpretations and understandings of the world, and can often lead to conflicts with secular laws and norms. As societies continue to modernize and secularize, it is likely that the tensions between fundamentalist and secular views will continue to be a significant issue[^51^].
