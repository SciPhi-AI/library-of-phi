## Chapter 1: Introduction



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex phenomenon that occurs in both the ocean and the atmosphere, is a subject of great interest and study. It is a fundamental aspect of fluid dynamics, influencing a wide range of natural processes and human activities. This book, "Turbulence in the Ocean and Atmosphere: A Comprehensive Study", aims to delve into the intricacies of this phenomenon, providing a detailed and comprehensive understanding of its occurrence, characteristics, and implications.



In this introductory chapter, we will set the stage for the subsequent exploration of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. We will begin by defining turbulence, discussing its basic properties and the mathematical framework used to describe it. We will then briefly touch upon the significance of turbulence in the context of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, highlighting its role in various processes such as heat transfer, momentum exchange, and mixing of substances.



The study of turbulence is not just an academic exercise; it has practical implications in a variety of fields. For instance, understanding atmospheric turbulence is crucial for improving weather forecasting models, while knowledge of oceanic turbulence can aid in predicting sea currents and waves, which are of vital importance for navigation and offshore engineering.



However, studying turbulence is no easy task. It is a highly complex and chaotic phenomenon, characterized by irregular fluctuations and a wide range of scales. The mathematical description of turbulence involves non-linear partial differential equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, which are notoriously difficult to solve. Moreover, the experimental study of turbulence poses its own set of challenges, due to the difficulty in measuring turbulent flows with sufficient accuracy and resolution.



Despite these challenges, the study of turbulence has made significant strides over the years, thanks to advances in mathematical techniques, computational methods, and experimental technologies. This book aims to present a comprehensive overview of these developments, providing a deep and nuanced understanding of turbulence in the ocean and the atmosphere.



As we embark on this journey of exploration, we hope to shed light on the fascinating world of turbulence, unraveling its complexities and revealing its profound implications for our understanding of the natural world.



### Section: 1.1 Transition to Turbulence



The transition from laminar to turbulent flow is a complex process that has been the subject of extensive research. This transition is characterized by the onset of chaotic, unpredictable motion in a fluid, which can occur under a variety of conditions. The Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity that describes the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid, plays a crucial role in this transition. When the Reynolds number exceeds a certain critical value, the flow becomes unstable and transitions to turbulence.



#### 1.1a Definition of Turbulence



Turbulence can be defined as a state of fluid motion characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity. It is a complex, multi-scale phenomenon that involves a wide range of interacting eddies or vortices, which are essentially swirling regions of fluid. These eddies can vary in size from the very small, which are affected by the viscosity of the fluid, to the very large, which are influenced by the overall size and geometry of the fluid domain.



The concept of turbulence was further refined by Richardson, who proposed the idea of an energy cascade. According to this concept, energy in a turbulent flow is transferred from large eddies to progressively smaller ones, until it is eventually dissipated as heat due to the viscosity of the fluid. This process is often referred to as the Richardson energy cascade.



Kolmogorov further developed this concept in his 1941 theory, postulating that at very high Reynolds numbers, the small-scale turbulent motions are statistically isotropic, meaning they have no preferential spatial direction. He also introduced the idea that the statistics of small scales are universally and uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity and the rate of energy dissipation.



The length scale at which energy is dissipated in a turbulent flow can be determined using these two parameters, according to the following relation derived from dimensional analysis:



$$

\eta = \left(\frac{{\nu^3}}{\varepsilon}\right)^{1/4}

$$



where $\eta$ is the Kolmogorov length scale, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\varepsilon$ is the rate of energy dissipation. This length scale represents the size of the smallest eddies in a turbulent flow, where energy is dissipated as heat.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical description of turbulence, and explore its implications in the context of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics.



#### 1.1b Reynolds Number and Turbulent Flow



The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity that plays a pivotal role in the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. It is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and is used to predict the onset of turbulence in a fluid. Mathematically, it is given by:



$$

Re = \frac{\rho u L}{\mu}

$$



where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $u$ is the characteristic velocity, $L$ is the characteristic length, and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.



The critical Reynolds number, above which the flow becomes turbulent, depends on the specific flow configuration. For example, in pipe flow, the critical Reynolds number is approximately 2300, while for flow over a flat plate, it is around $5 \times 10^5$.



The Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model, a one-equation model, is often used in computational fluid dynamics to simulate turbulent flows. This model introduces a modified turbulent viscosity $\tilde{\nu}$, which is computed using a set of equations involving various constants and functions. The model has been modified over time to improve its accuracy and safety, and has been adapted for compressible flows.



The turbulent eddy viscosity in the Spalart–Allmaras model is given by:



$$

\frac{\partial \tilde{\nu}}{\partial t} + u_j \frac{\partial \tilde{\nu}}{\partial x_j} = C_{b1} [1 - f_{t2}] \tilde{S} \tilde{\nu} + \frac{1}{\sigma} \{ \nabla \cdot [(\nu + \tilde{\nu}) \nabla \tilde{\nu}] + C_{b2} | \nabla \tilde{\nu} |^2 \} - \left[C_{w1} f_w - \frac{C_{b1}}{\kappa^2} f_{t2}\right] \left( \frac{\tilde{\nu}}{d} \right)^2 + f_{t1} \Delta U^2

$$



where $f_{t1}$ and $f_{t2}$ are functions of the turbulence model, and the constants $\sigma$, $C_{b1}$, $C_{b2}$, $\kappa$, $C_{w1}$, and others are determined empirically.



The Reynolds number, along with turbulence models like the Spalart–Allmaras model, provide valuable tools for understanding and predicting the complex behavior of turbulent flows. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the nature of turbulence and explore other important concepts and models in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### 1.1c Instability and Transition to Turbulence



The transition from laminar to turbulent flow is not an abrupt process but rather a gradual one, marked by the onset of instabilities in the flow. These instabilities, which can be triggered by a variety of factors, lead to the development of turbulence. Two such instabilities, the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and the streaming instability, provide illustrative examples of this process.



##### Rayleigh–Taylor Instability



The Rayleigh–Taylor instability occurs when a denser fluid is accelerated into a lighter one. This situation can arise in a variety of contexts, such as the interface between the ocean and the atmosphere, or in astrophysical phenomena like supernova explosions.



In the early stages of this instability, small perturbations at the interface between the two fluids grow exponentially with time. However, as these perturbations increase in amplitude, the linear analysis breaks down. The spikes and bubbles of the instability begin to tangle and roll up into vortices, leading to a non-linear growth phase. At this point, numerical simulations are typically required to accurately describe the system.



##### Streaming Instability



The streaming instability, first described by Andrew Youdin and Jeremy Goodman, is another example of a process that can lead to turbulence. This instability arises due to differences in the motions of gas and solid particles in a protoplanetary disk.



In this scenario, the gas is hotter and denser closer to the star, creating a pressure gradient that partially offsets gravity. This allows the gas to orbit at a velocity slightly below the Keplerian velocity. Solid particles, however, are not supported by the pressure gradient and would orbit at Keplerian velocities in the absence of the gas. The difference in velocities results in a headwind that causes the solid particles to spiral toward the central star as they lose momentum to aerodynamic drag.



When solid particles cluster in the gas, the reaction reduces the headwind locally, allowing the cluster to orbit faster and undergo less inward drift. This leads to an exponential growth of the initial clusters, which can form massive filaments. These filaments can grow or dissipate, and can collide and merge or split into multiple filaments. The densities of the filaments can exceed a thousand times the gas density, sufficient to trigger the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of the filaments into bound clusters.



Both the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and the streaming instability illustrate how small perturbations can grow and evolve into complex, turbulent flows. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting and modeling turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models used to describe these and other types of turbulence.



#### 1.1d Turbulence in the Ocean and Atmosphere



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is a fundamental aspect of fluid dynamics that plays a significant role in both the ocean and the atmosphere. It is characterized by irregular fluctuations and mixing, leading to the dispersion and diffusion of properties such as momentum, heat, and other scalar quantities. 



In the ocean, turbulence is a key factor in the transport and mixing of heat, salt, and other tracers, which are crucial for the general circulation and the climate system. The oceanic turbulence is primarily generated by wind stress at the surface and by breaking internal waves at the interfaces between water masses of different densities. 



In the atmosphere, turbulence is responsible for the transport of heat, moisture, and momentum, which are essential for weather and climate. Atmospheric turbulence is mainly generated by thermal convection and wind shear. 



Despite the importance of turbulence, it is challenging to represent in numerical models due to its wide range of scales. In the ocean and atmosphere, the scales of turbulence can range from millimeters to hundreds of kilometers, which is far beyond the resolution of current numerical models. Therefore, subgrid-scale (SGS) parameterizations are used to represent the effects of unresolved turbulence on the resolved scales.



The SGS parameterizations are based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, which separate the flow into resolved and unresolved components. The unresolved component, or the Reynolds stress, is parameterized as a function of the resolved flow. However, this approach leads to the closure problem, as new variables arise at each level in the Reynolds averaging procedure. 



To address the closure problem, various SGS mixing schemes have been developed. These schemes can be categorized into different branches, such as lateral and vertical subgrid-scale closure. Filters and higher-order operators are used to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary. Special dynamical parameterizations are also available for certain processes, such as topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion, and convection.



In the vertical direction, the surface mixed layer (SML) has received special attention due to its important role in air-sea exchange. The SML is the upper layer of the ocean where the properties are nearly uniform due to the strong mixing by wind and waves. Various schemes have been developed to represent the SML in ocean models, which take into account the effects of wind, waves, buoyancy flux, and shear.



In conclusion, turbulence is a fundamental aspect of the ocean and atmosphere that plays a crucial role in the transport and mixing of properties. Despite its importance, turbulence is challenging to represent in numerical models due to its wide range of scales. Therefore, SGS parameterizations are used to represent the effects of unresolved turbulence on the resolved scales. Various SGS mixing schemes have been developed to address the closure problem and to represent the effects of turbulence in different processes and regions.



### Section: 1.2 Statistics and Turbulence:



Turbulence, due to its chaotic and unpredictable nature, is a complex phenomenon to study. However, statistical methods provide a powerful tool to analyze and understand turbulence. The statistical approach to turbulence involves the use of statistical measures and probability distributions to describe the properties of turbulent flows. 



#### 1.2a Statistical Measures of Turbulence



Statistical measures of turbulence include mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, among others. These measures provide information about the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the turbulence data distribution. 



The mean, denoted as $\mu$, is the average value of the turbulent variable, such as velocity or temperature. It represents the central tendency of the data. 



The variance, denoted as $\sigma^2$, measures the dispersion of the turbulent variable around the mean. It provides information about the intensity of the turbulence. 



Skewness, denoted as $\gamma_1$, measures the asymmetry of the turbulence data distribution. A positive skewness indicates that the data distribution has a long right tail, while a negative skewness indicates a long left tail. 



Kurtosis, denoted as $\gamma_2$, measures the "tailedness" of the turbulence data distribution. A high kurtosis indicates a distribution with heavy tails and a sharp peak, suggesting large fluctuations in the turbulent variable. 



These statistical measures can be calculated from the turbulence data using the following formulas:



$$

\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i

$$



$$

\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2

$$



$$

\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^3

$$



$$

\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^4 - 3

$$



where $N$ is the number of data points, and $x_i$ is the $i$-th data point.



In the following sections, we will discuss how these statistical measures are used in turbulence modeling and how they relate to the physical properties of turbulent flows.



#### 1.2b Turbulent Energy Spectra



The turbulent energy spectrum is a fundamental concept in the study of turbulence. It provides a description of how the energy of a turbulent flow is distributed among different scales or sizes of eddies, which are swirling vortices of fluid. 



The energy spectrum, denoted as $E(k)$, is a function of the wave number $k$, which is inversely proportional to the size of the eddies. The wave number is defined as $k = 2\pi/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength or size of the eddies. 



The energy spectrum is defined as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the turbulent variable. The autocorrelation function, denoted as $R(\tau)$, is a measure of the correlation of the turbulent variable with itself at different time lags $\tau$. It is defined as:



$$

R(\tau) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)(x_{i+\tau} - \mu)

$$



where $N$ is the number of data points, $x_i$ is the $i$-th data point, and $\mu$ is the mean of the data. 



The energy spectrum $E(k)$ can then be calculated as the Fourier transform of $R(\tau)$:



$$

E(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} R(\tau) e^{-ik\tau} d\tau

$$



The energy spectrum provides valuable information about the distribution of energy among different scales of eddies in a turbulent flow. For example, in the inertial subrange of the energy spectrum, where the energy transfer from large to small scales is dominated by nonlinear interactions and is independent of viscosity, the energy spectrum follows the famous Kolmogorov's -5/3 law:



$$

E(k) \propto k^{-5/3}

$$



This law indicates that the energy of the turbulence is predominantly contained in the large-scale eddies, and the energy decreases as the scale of the eddies decreases.



In the next section, we will discuss the generation of turbulence and the use of power spectra and spectral matrices in the simulation of turbulence, using the Sandia method as an example.



#### 1.2c Turbulence Intensity and Dissipation Rate



Turbulence intensity and dissipation rate are two key parameters in the study of turbulence. Turbulence intensity, often denoted as $I$, is a measure of the fluctuations in the velocity of a turbulent flow relative to the mean flow velocity. It is defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) of the velocity fluctuations divided by the mean flow velocity:



$$

I = \frac{\sqrt{\overline{u'^2}}}{\overline{U}}

$$



where $\overline{u'^2}$ is the mean square of the velocity fluctuations and $\overline{U}$ is the mean flow velocity. Turbulence intensity is a dimensionless quantity and it provides a measure of the unsteadiness of the flow. High turbulence intensity indicates a highly unsteady or chaotic flow, while low turbulence intensity indicates a more steady or laminar flow.



The dissipation rate of turbulence, often denoted as $\epsilon$, is a measure of the rate at which the turbulent kinetic energy is converted into internal energy (or heat) by viscous forces. It is defined as:



$$

\epsilon = 2\nu \overline{S_{ij}S_{ij}}

$$



where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and $S_{ij}$ is the rate of strain tensor, which is a measure of the rate of deformation of the fluid elements due to the turbulent flow. The overline denotes an average over time or space.



The dissipation rate is a key parameter in turbulence modeling, as it determines the rate at which energy is removed from the large-scale eddies and transferred to the small-scale eddies, where it is dissipated as heat. This process is known as the energy cascade in turbulence.



In the next section, we will discuss the statistical methods used to analyze turbulence, including the use of probability density functions and correlation functions. We will also discuss the role of turbulence in the transport of momentum, heat, and mass in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### 1.2d Turbulence Modeling Techniques



Turbulence modeling is a critical aspect of understanding and predicting the behavior of turbulent flows in the ocean and atmosphere. Several models have been developed to simulate turbulence, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used turbulence models, including the Spalart–Allmaras, "k"–ε, and "k"–ω models, as well as the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) technique.



##### Spalart–Allmaras, "k"–ε and "k"–ω models



The Spalart–Allmaras (S–A), "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon), and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models are based on the Boussinesq hypothesis, which provides a relatively low-cost computation for the turbulence viscosity, denoted as $\nu_t$. The S–A model uses only one additional equation to model turbulence viscosity transport, while the "k"–ε and "k"–ω models use two.



The "k"–ε model is widely used due to its robustness and simplicity. It involves two equations: one for the turbulent kinetic energy $k$ and another for the dissipation rate $\epsilon$. The "k"–ω model, on the other hand, replaces the dissipation rate equation with an equation for the specific dissipation rate $\omega$, which can provide more accurate results near walls and in regions with adverse pressure gradients.



##### Detached Eddy Simulation (DES)



Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) is a modification of a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) model. In DES, the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations. 



Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. This approach reduces the computational cost compared to pure LES, making DES a practical choice for many engineering applications.



Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model, it can be implemented with other RANS models by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. 



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these models, discussing their mathematical formulations, assumptions, and applications in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Conclusion

## Chapter 2: Convection



### Introduction



Convection, a fundamental process in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, is the focus of this chapter. This process, which involves the transfer of heat and other properties by the movement of mass, plays a crucial role in shaping the patterns of weather and climate, as well as influencing the distribution of marine life and nutrients in the ocean.



In the atmosphere, convection is responsible for the formation of clouds and precipitation, and it drives the circulation of air on a global scale. It is the engine behind thunderstorms and hurricanes, and it is a key factor in the development of weather fronts and the jet stream. In the ocean, convection helps to mix the water column, bringing cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface and sending warm, less dense water to the depths. This mixing is vital for the health of marine ecosystems, and it also has important implications for the global climate system.



In this chapter, we will delve into the physics of convection, exploring the equations and principles that govern this process. We will examine how convection operates in different environments and under different conditions, and we will look at the tools and techniques that scientists use to study it. We will also discuss the role of convection in larger-scale phenomena, such as El Niño and the North Atlantic Oscillation.



Understanding convection is not just an academic exercise. It has practical applications in many fields, from weather forecasting to climate modeling to oceanography. By gaining a deeper understanding of convection, we can improve our ability to predict and respond to natural disasters, manage marine resources, and anticipate the impacts of climate change.



In the following sections, we will embark on a journey through the fascinating world of convection, exploring its complexities, its mysteries, and its profound importance to life on Earth.



### Section: 2.1 3D Turbulence:



#### Subsection: 2.1a Three-Dimensional Fluid Motion



In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of two-dimensional flow in orthogonal coordinates. Now, we will extend our discussion to three-dimensional fluid motion, which is a more realistic representation of the turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



The three-dimensional flow velocity is expressed as:



$$

\mathbf{v} = v_{1} \mathbf{e}_{1} + v_{2} \mathbf{e}_{2} + v_{3} \mathbf{e}_{3}

$$



where $\mathbf{e}_{1}$, $\mathbf{e}_{2}$, and $\mathbf{e}_{3}$ are basis vectors, not necessarily constant and not necessarily normalized, and $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, and $v_{3}$ are flow velocity components. Let also the coordinates of space be $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$.



Unlike the two-dimensional case, in three-dimensional fluid motion, all components of flow velocity are generally non-zero and dependent on all three spatial directions. This results in a more complex behavior of the fluid, characterized by a phenomenon known as turbulence.



Turbulence is a highly chaotic and unpredictable state of fluid motion, characterized by vortices, eddies, and rapid changes in pressure and velocity. It is a key factor in the transport of momentum, heat, and other properties in the ocean and atmosphere.



The mathematical description of turbulence is a challenging task due to its complex, chaotic nature. However, the Navier-Stokes equations, which we derived in the previous chapter, provide a fundamental framework for studying this phenomenon. These equations, which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, can be used to model turbulence by incorporating a statistical approach.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of three-dimensional turbulence, exploring its characteristics, its mathematical description, and its role in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. We will also discuss the techniques and tools used by scientists to study turbulence, and we will examine some of the challenges and open questions in this fascinating field of research.



#### Subsection: 2.1b Turbulent Convection in the Ocean and Atmosphere



Turbulent convection is a fundamental process in the ocean and atmosphere, playing a crucial role in the transport of heat, momentum, and other properties. In this section, we will focus on the phenomena involved in convection, particularly deep convection, and its implications for turbulence.



Deep convection in the ocean and atmosphere is distinguished into small-scale and mesoscale processes. The smallest-scale process is represented by plumes, while chimneys (patch) and eddies represent the mesoscale.



##### Plumes



Plumes are the initial convectively driven vertical motions formed during the second phase of convection. They have horizontal scales between 100m and 1 km and vertical scales around 1–2 km, with vertical velocities of up to 10 cm/s, as measured by acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCPs). The time scales associated with convective plumes range from several hours to several days.



In terms of their dynamic part, plumes act as either "conduits" or "mixing agents". When acting as "conduits", they transport cooled and dense surface water downward, serving as the primary mechanism for water transport towards lower depths and its renewal. However, when plumes act as "mixing agents", they cool and mix a patch of water, creating a dense homogeneous cylinder, akin to a chimney, which eventually collapses and adjusts under the influence of planetary rotation and gravity.



Two important factors in deep convective plumes are the Coriolis force and thermobaricity. Thermobaricity is the effect in which sinking cold saline water is formed under freezing conditions, resulting in downward acceleration. Many numerical and tank modeling experiments have examined the role of rotation in the processes of convection and in the morphology of the plumes. According to Paluszkiewicz et al. (1994), planetary rotation does not affect the individual plumes vertically, but does so horizontally. Under the influence of rotation, the diameter of the plumes becomes smaller compared to the diameter of the plumes in the absence of rotation. In contrast, chimneys and associated eddies are dominated by the effects of rotation due to thermal wind.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of turbulent convection, exploring its characteristics, its mathematical description, and its role in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. We will also discuss the techniques and tools used by scientists to study turbulent convection, and we will examine the implications of this phenomenon for our understanding of the Earth's climate system.



#### Subsection: 2.1c Convective Heat and Mass Transfer



Convective heat and mass transfer is a critical aspect of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. It is the process by which heat and mass are transported from one location to another through the movement of fluids. This process is driven by the buoyancy forces that result from density differences due to variations in temperature and concentration.



The general equation of heat transfer, as derived in Section 49 of L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz's "Course of Theoretical Physics", can be applied to understand convective heat and mass transfer in the context of turbulence. The equation for entropy production, given by:



$$

\rho T \frac{Ds}{Dt} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa\nabla T) + \frac{\mu}{2}\left( \frac{\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}} + \frac{\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}} - \frac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\nabla\cdot {\bf v} \right)^{2} + \zeta(\nabla \cdot {\bf v})^{2}

$$



shows that in the absence of thermal conduction and viscous forces, the equation for entropy production collapses to $Ds/Dt=0$, indicating that ideal fluid flow is isentropic.



In the context of turbulence, convective heat and mass transfer can be understood through the concept of eddies. Eddies are swirling motions of fluid that transport heat and mass from one region to another. The size and intensity of these eddies can vary, leading to a wide range of heat and mass transfer rates.



In the ocean, convective heat and mass transfer play a significant role in the formation of ocean currents and the distribution of heat and nutrients. For instance, the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, is driven by convective heat transfer from the tropics to the North Atlantic. Similarly, in the atmosphere, convective heat transfer is responsible for the formation of weather systems such as thunderstorms and hurricanes.



Understanding convective heat and mass transfer is crucial for predicting and modeling the behavior of the ocean and atmosphere. It is also essential for various practical applications, such as the design of heating elements and the operation of domestic refrigerators. For instance, an electrode boiler uses electricity flowing through streams to heat water, a process that involves convective heat transfer.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical modeling of convective heat and mass transfer, focusing on the Navier-Stokes equations and their application to turbulence.



#### Subsection: 2.1d Numerical Models of 3D Turbulence



Numerical models of 3D turbulence are essential tools for understanding and predicting the behavior of turbulent flows in the ocean and atmosphere. These models use mathematical equations to simulate the complex interactions between fluid particles and the forces acting upon them. 



One of the most commonly used numerical models for turbulence is the Spalart–Allmaras (S–A) model. This model employs the Boussinesq hypothesis, which offers a relatively low-cost computation for the turbulence viscosity $\nu_t$. The S–A model uses only one additional equation to model turbulence viscosity transport, making it a computationally efficient choice for many applications.



The "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon) and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models are two other popular turbulence models that also use the Boussinesq hypothesis. However, these models use two additional equations to model turbulence viscosity transport, making them more computationally demanding than the S–A model. Despite this, the "k"–ε and "k"–ω models are often preferred for their ability to accurately capture the behavior of turbulent flows in a wide range of conditions.



Detached eddy simulation (DES) is another important numerical model used in turbulence studies. DES is a modification of a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS) model that switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for large eddy simulation (LES) calculations. This approach allows DES to provide a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solution, making it a powerful tool for studying turbulence in complex geometries and flow conditions.



In the context of convection, these numerical models can be used to simulate the transport of heat and mass by turbulent eddies. By accurately capturing the behavior of these eddies, these models can provide valuable insights into the formation of ocean currents, the distribution of heat and nutrients in the ocean, and the development of weather systems in the atmosphere.



In conclusion, numerical models of 3D turbulence are indispensable tools for studying turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. By leveraging the power of these models, scientists and engineers can gain a deeper understanding of turbulent flows and develop more accurate predictions of their behavior.



#### Subsection: 2.2a Two-Dimensional Fluid Motion



In the study of turbulence, two-dimensional (2D) fluid motion provides a simplified yet insightful perspective into the complex nature of turbulent flows. This section will delve into the mathematical representation of 2D turbulence, building upon the Navier-Stokes equations derived in the previous chapter.



As we have previously discussed, the flow velocity in a 3D system can be expressed as:



$$

\mathbf{v} = v_{1} \mathbf{e}_{1} + v_{2} \mathbf{e}_{2} + v_{3} \mathbf{e}_{3}

$$



where $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ are basis vectors, and $v_{i}$ are flow velocity components. However, in a 2D flow, one component of the flow velocity is zero, and the remaining components are independent of the same direction. For simplicity, let's assume the third component to be zero:



$$

\mathbf{v} = v_{1} \mathbf{e}_{1} + v_{2} \mathbf{e}_{2}

$$



The vector function $\mathbf{\psi}$ is defined via:



$$

\mathbf{\psi} = \psi_{1} \mathbf{e}_{1} + \psi_{2} \mathbf{e}_{2} + \psi_{3} \mathbf{e}_{3}

$$



However, since the flow is assumed 2D, this simplifies to:



$$

\mathbf{\psi} = \psi_{1} \mathbf{e}_{1} + \psi_{2} \mathbf{e}_{2}

$$



In orthogonal coordinates, the curl takes on a simple form, and the equation above expanded becomes:



$$

\frac{\mathbf{e}_{1}}{h_{2} h_{3}} 

\left[

\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}} \left( h_{3} \psi_{3} \right) - 

\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{3}} \left( h_{2} \psi_{2} \right)

\right] + 

\frac{\mathbf{e}_{2}}{h_{3} h_{1}} 

\left[

\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{3}} \left( h_{1} \psi_{1} \right) - 

\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}} \left( h_{3} \psi_{3} \right)

\right] + 

\frac{\mathbf{e}_{3}}{h_{1} h_{2}} 

\left[

\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}} \left( h_{2} \psi_{2} \right) - 

\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}} \left( h_{1} \psi_{1} \right)

\right]

$$



Examining this equation shows that we can set $\psi_{3} = 0$ and retain equality with no loss of generality, so that:



$$

\frac{\mathbf{e}_{1}}{h_{2} h_{3}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}} \left( h_{3} \psi_{3} \right) = 0

$$



This simplification is a key step in the analysis of 2D turbulence, as it reduces the complexity of the equations governing fluid motion. In the following sections, we will explore how this simplification can be applied to study the behavior of turbulent flows in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### Subsection: 2.2b Geostrophic Turbulence



Geostrophic turbulence is a form of two-dimensional turbulence that is influenced by the rotation of the Earth. It is a key component in the dynamics of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic flows. The quasi-geostrophic approximation, as discussed in the previous section, provides a mathematical framework for understanding geostrophic turbulence.



The quasi-geostrophic approximation simplifies the equations of motion by assuming that the horizontal flow is nearly balanced by the Coriolis force. This approximation is valid when the Rossby number, $Ro$, is much less than one ($Ro \ll 1$). The Rossby number is the ratio of inertial forces to Coriolis forces and is typically small for large-scale geophysical flows.



In the quasi-geostrophic approximation, the horizontal velocity components are given by:



$$

u = \bar{u}+\tilde{u} \quad \text{with} \quad \bar{u}=-\frac{g}{f_0}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}

$$



$$

v = \bar{v}+\tilde{v} \quad \text{with} \quad \bar{v}=\frac{g}{f_0}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}

$$



where $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$ are the geostrophic flow components and $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ are the ageostrophic flow components. The geostrophic flow components are in balance with the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force, while the ageostrophic components represent deviations from this balance.



Substituting these expressions into the continuity equation and neglecting terms where small component terms ($\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}, \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ and $\alpha_0$) are multiplied, we obtain:



$$

\tilde{v} = -\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y \partial t}

$$



$$

\tilde{u} = -\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x \partial t}

$$



$$

\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}+H_0\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 \frac{g}{f_0}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}=0

$$



These equations describe the evolution of the ageostrophic components and the surface elevation $\eta$ in a quasi-geostrophic flow. They form the basis for the study of geostrophic turbulence.



In the next section, we will explore the energy cascade in geostrophic turbulence, which is a key feature distinguishing it from classical 2D turbulence.



#### Subsection: 2.2c Quasigeostrophic Dynamics



Quasigeostrophic dynamics is a fundamental aspect of understanding turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. It is a simplification of the full equations of motion that is applicable when the Rossby number is much less than one ($Ro \ll 1$). This approximation is particularly useful in the study of large-scale geophysical flows where the Coriolis force is in balance with the pressure gradient force.



In the previous section, we derived the expressions for the ageostrophic velocity components, $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$, in terms of the geostrophic flow components, $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$, and the vertical displacement of the fluid surface, $\eta$. We also obtained an equation for the evolution of $\eta$:



$$

\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}+H_0\left(\frac{\partial \tilde{u}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tilde{v}}{\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 \frac{g}{f_0}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}=0

$$



Substituting the expressions for $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ into this equation, we obtain:



$$

\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}-H_0\left(\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^3 \eta}{\partial x^2 \partial t} + \frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^3 \eta}{\partial y^2 \partial t}\right)+\alpha_0 \frac{g}{f_0}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}=0

$$



This equation describes the evolution of the fluid surface in the quasigeostrophic approximation. It is a partial differential equation that can be solved numerically to study the dynamics of geophysical flows.



In the next section, we will discuss the concept of potential vorticity and its conservation in quasigeostrophic dynamics. This will provide us with a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of large-scale geophysical flows.



```

#### Subsection: 2.2d Vortices and Jets in 2D Turbulence



In the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, vortices and jets play a significant role. These are two-dimensional (2D) structures that are commonly observed in geophysical flows. In this section, we will discuss the formation and dynamics of these structures in the context of 2D turbulence.



Vortices in 2D turbulence are regions of the fluid where the flow is rotating around a point. They are formed by the interaction of shear and buoyancy forces in the fluid. The vortex method, a meshfree technique for the simulation of incompressible turbulent flows, is often used to study these structures. In this method, vorticity is discretized onto Lagrangian particles, which are then used to compute velocities and study the dynamics of the vortices.



Jets, on the other hand, are narrow regions of the fluid where the flow is significantly faster than in the surrounding areas. They are typically formed by the interaction of vortices, and their dynamics can be studied using high-resolution discretization schemes. These schemes are particularly useful for capturing sharp changes in the solution, such as those observed at the boundaries of the jets.



The dynamics of vortices and jets in 2D turbulence can be described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These equations can be discretized using the boundary element method, where the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh. The solution to these equations provides a detailed description of the flow field, including the formation and evolution of vortices and jets.



The interaction of vortices and jets plays a crucial role in the energy transfer in 2D turbulence. In particular, the merging of vortices can lead to the formation of larger vortices and jets, which can then transport energy over large distances. This process is known as the inverse energy cascade, and it is a key feature of 2D turbulence.



In the next section, we will discuss the role of stratification in 2D turbulence, and how it affects the dynamics of vortices and jets.

```



### Section: 2.3 QG Turbulence:



#### Subsection: 2.3a Quasi-Geostrophic Approximation



In the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, the quasi-geostrophic (QG) approximation plays a crucial role. This approximation simplifies the equations of motion by assuming that the horizontal length scales are much larger than the vertical scales, and that the flow is nearly geostrophic. 



The QG approximation is defined as follows:



$$

u = \bar{u}+\tilde{u} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{u}=-{g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial y}\\[3pt]

v = \bar{v}+\tilde{v} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{v}={g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x},

$$



where $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$ are the geostrophic flow components and $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ are the ageostrophic flow components with $\tilde{u}\ll\bar{u}$ and $\tilde{v}\ll\bar{v}$. 



Substituting these expressions for $u$ and $v$ in the previously acquired set of equations, we obtain:



$$

-{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial t}-f_0\tilde{v} = 0\\[3pt]

{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial t}+f_0\tilde{u} = 0\\[3pt]

{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}+ \alpha_0\tilde{v}=0.

$$



Neglecting terms where small component terms ($\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}, {\partial\over\partial t}$ and $\alpha_0$) are multiplied, the expressions obtained are:



$$

\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]

\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]

{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.

$$



Substituting the components of the ageostrophic velocity in the continuity equation, we obtain:



$$

{\partial \eta \over\partial t}-R^2{\partial\over\partial t}\nabla^2 \eta + \alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.

$$



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of the QG approximation for the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. We will also discuss how this approximation is used in numerical models to simulate geophysical flows.



#### Subsection: 2.3b Rossby Waves and Vortices



Rossby waves, also known as planetary waves, are a natural phenomenon in the oceans and atmosphere that play a significant role in the Earth's weather. They are a direct result of the rotation of the planet. In the context of quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence, these waves are crucial as they are responsible for the large-scale motion in the ocean and atmosphere.



The Rossby waves are characterized by their slow westward movement. They are generated by the rotation of the Earth and the fluid's inertia. The waves are influenced by the Coriolis effect, which causes the fluid to turn to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This effect is responsible for the creation of vortices.



Vortices, in the context of QG turbulence, are regions in a fluid where the flow is primarily rotational. In the ocean and atmosphere, these vortices can be seen as cyclones and anticyclones. The vortices are influenced by the Coriolis effect, which causes them to rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.



The interaction between Rossby waves and vortices is complex and leads to a variety of phenomena. For instance, the propagation of Rossby waves can lead to the formation of large-scale vortices. Conversely, vortices can generate Rossby waves, leading to a feedback mechanism that can enhance or suppress the development of these waves.



The equations derived in the previous section can be used to study the dynamics of Rossby waves and vortices. For instance, the ageostrophic velocity components $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ can be used to describe the motion of the fluid in the presence of Rossby waves and vortices. The continuity equation, which describes the conservation of mass in the fluid, can be used to study the formation and evolution of vortices.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical description of Rossby waves and vortices, and explore how they contribute to the turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### Subsection: 2.3c QG Turbulence in the Ocean and Atmosphere



Quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence is a fundamental concept in understanding the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. It is a simplification of the full Navier-Stokes equations that govern fluid motion, which assumes that the horizontal length scales are much larger than the vertical scales, and that the fluid motion is nearly horizontal. This approximation is valid for large-scale motions in the ocean and atmosphere, where the Coriolis effect due to the Earth's rotation is significant.



In the context of QG turbulence, the ocean and atmosphere are considered as stratified fluids. The stratification is due to the variation in temperature and salinity in the ocean, and temperature and humidity in the atmosphere. This stratification leads to the formation of layers in the fluid, which can interact with each other through turbulent mixing.



The QG turbulence is characterized by the interaction between the large-scale geostrophic flow and the small-scale turbulent eddies. The geostrophic flow is a balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force, which leads to a flow that is parallel to the isobars. The turbulent eddies are generated by instabilities in the geostrophic flow, and they can transport heat, momentum, and other properties across the isobars.



The mathematical description of QG turbulence involves the QG potential vorticity equation, which is derived from the conservation of potential vorticity in the fluid. The potential vorticity is a measure of the rotation and stratification of the fluid, and it is conserved in the absence of friction and diabatic processes. The QG potential vorticity equation can be written as:



$$

\frac{Dq}{Dt} = \frac{\partial q}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla q = 0

$$



where $D/Dt$ is the material derivative, $q$ is the potential vorticity, $t$ is time, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, and $\nabla$ is the gradient operator.



The QG turbulence can be studied using numerical simulations, which solve the QG potential vorticity equation on a grid. The simulations can include subgridscale parameterizations to account for the effects of the turbulent eddies that are not resolved by the grid. These parameterizations can be based on the Reynolds approach, which involves averaging the equations over a small volume of fluid.



In the next section, we will discuss the role of QG turbulence in the formation and evolution of large-scale structures in the ocean and atmosphere, such as the Gulf Stream and the jet streams.



#### Subsection: 2.3d QG Turbulence Modeling



Modeling QG turbulence is a complex task due to the non-linear nature of the interactions between the geostrophic flow and the turbulent eddies. However, it is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of the ocean and atmosphere. 



One of the most common approaches to modeling QG turbulence is through the use of the Quasi-Geostrophic Potential Vorticity (QGPV) equation, which we introduced in the previous section. This equation can be solved numerically using various methods, such as finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods. 



However, these numerical methods can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale simulations. Therefore, turbulence models are often used to approximate the effects of the turbulent eddies on the geostrophic flow. These models are based on statistical theories of turbulence, such as the Kolmogorov theory, and they involve the introduction of a turbulence closure scheme.



A common turbulence closure scheme used in QG turbulence modeling is the eddy viscosity model. In this model, the effects of the turbulent eddies are represented by an effective viscosity, which is added to the molecular viscosity in the QGPV equation. The eddy viscosity is usually parameterized as a function of the local shear and stratification of the fluid.



The modified QGPV equation with the eddy viscosity model can be written as:



$$

\frac{Dq}{Dt} = \nu \nabla^2 q

$$



where $\nu$ is the eddy viscosity, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. 



This equation is still non-linear and requires numerical solution, but the introduction of the eddy viscosity model simplifies the representation of the turbulent eddies and reduces the computational cost of the simulation.



It should be noted that the eddy viscosity model is a simplification and does not capture all the complexities of QG turbulence. More advanced turbulence models, such as the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, can provide a more accurate representation of QG turbulence, but they are also more computationally expensive.



In conclusion, modeling QG turbulence is a challenging task that involves a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Despite these challenges, the development and application of QG turbulence models have significantly advanced our understanding of the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere.



### Conclusion



In this chapter, we have delved into the complex and fascinating world of convection, a key process in the dynamics of both the ocean and the atmosphere. We have explored how convection, driven by the buoyancy forces arising from temperature and salinity differences, plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, momentum, and mass in these systems. 



We have also examined the intricate interplay between convection and turbulence. We have seen how convective processes can generate turbulence, and how this turbulence, in turn, can influence the evolution of convective systems. This feedback loop between convection and turbulence is a critical component of the larger-scale dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere.



Finally, we have discussed some of the challenges in studying and modeling convection. Despite the advances in observational techniques and numerical models, our understanding of convection is still incomplete. The inherent complexity and variability of convective processes, coupled with the difficulties in accurately capturing these processes in models, make convection a challenging and exciting area of research.

## Chapter 3: Mean-Field Approximation



### Introduction



The Mean-Field Approximation is a critical concept in understanding turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of this approximation, its applications, and its limitations. 



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is ubiquitous in both the ocean and the atmosphere. It plays a significant role in the transport and mixing of physical properties such as momentum, heat, and chemical constituents. Understanding turbulence is crucial for accurate weather prediction, climate modeling, and oceanography. However, the direct numerical simulation of turbulence is computationally expensive due to the wide range of scales involved. This is where the Mean-Field Approximation comes into play.



The Mean-Field Approximation is a powerful tool used to simplify the study of turbulence. It is based on the idea of representing the effect of all the small-scale turbulent eddies on the large-scale flow by an effective mean field. This approximation reduces the complexity of the problem by replacing the detailed dynamics of the turbulent eddies with their average effect on the mean flow.



In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical formulation of the Mean-Field Approximation, starting with the derivation of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. We will then discuss the closure problem associated with this approximation and various strategies to overcome it. 



We will also delve into the application of the Mean-Field Approximation in the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence. We will discuss how this approximation is used in numerical weather prediction models and ocean circulation models. 



Finally, we will address the limitations of the Mean-Field Approximation. While it is a powerful tool, it is not without its shortcomings. Understanding these limitations is crucial for the correct interpretation of the results obtained using this approximation.



By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the Mean-Field Approximation and its role in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 3.1 SQG Turbulence:



#### 3.1a Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Approximation



Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) turbulence is a specific type of turbulence that arises in the context of the ocean and atmosphere. It is characterized by the dominance of horizontal motions over vertical ones, and it is particularly relevant in the upper layers of the ocean and the lower layers of the atmosphere. 



The SQG approximation is a simplification of the quasi-geostrophic approximation, which we have previously discussed. It assumes that the vertical velocity is negligible compared to the horizontal velocities, and that the pressure is hydrostatic. This leads to a simplification of the equations of motion, which can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + J(\eta, \psi) = 0

$$



where $\eta$ is the potential vorticity, $\psi$ is the stream function, and $J$ is the Jacobian operator. This equation describes the evolution of the potential vorticity in the presence of advection by the geostrophic velocity.



The SQG approximation is particularly useful in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere because it reduces the complexity of the problem, making it more tractable for numerical simulations and analytical studies. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is an approximation, and it may not be valid in all situations. For example, it may not be applicable in regions with strong vertical motions, such as in the vicinity of deep convection or in the presence of strong topographic gradients.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of the SQG approximation, and we will discuss its applications and limitations in the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence. We will also explore how the SQG approximation can be used in conjunction with the Mean-Field Approximation to further simplify the study of turbulence.



#### 3.1b SQG Turbulence in the Ocean and Atmosphere



Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) turbulence plays a significant role in the ocean and atmosphere dynamics. In the ocean, SQG turbulence is particularly relevant in the upper layers where the horizontal motions dominate over the vertical ones. This is due to the stratification of the ocean, where the density of the water changes with depth. The SQG approximation is thus a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of the upper ocean, where the vertical velocity is often negligible compared to the horizontal velocities.



In the atmosphere, SQG turbulence is relevant in the lower layers, where the pressure is hydrostatic and the vertical motions are also negligible compared to the horizontal ones. This is particularly true in the boundary layer, where the air is in close contact with the Earth's surface. The SQG approximation can thus be used to study the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer, including the formation and evolution of weather systems.



The SQG turbulence is governed by the following equation:



$$

\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + J(\eta, \psi) = 0

$$



where $\eta$ is the potential vorticity, $\psi$ is the stream function, and $J$ is the Jacobian operator. This equation describes the evolution of the potential vorticity in the presence of advection by the geostrophic velocity.



The SQG turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere can interact with other scales of motion through the nonlinearities in the primitive equations. This interaction can lead to the generation of subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence, which needs to be parameterized in numerical models. The parameterization of SGS turbulence is a challenging problem in the study of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, and it is an active area of research.



In the next sections, we will discuss the parameterization of SGS turbulence in the context of the SQG approximation, and we will explore how the Mean-Field Approximation can be used to simplify this problem. We will also discuss the implications of the SQG turbulence for the large-scale circulation of the ocean and atmosphere, and we will explore its role in the transport of heat, momentum, and chemical species.



#### 3.1c SQG Turbulance Modeling



The modeling of Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) turbulence is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the underlying physics and the use of sophisticated numerical techniques. One of the key challenges in SQG turbulence modeling is the parameterization of subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence, which arises from the nonlinear interactions between different scales of motion.



The SGS turbulence represents the smallest scales of motion that are not resolved in the numerical model. These scales can have a significant impact on the larger scales of motion, and their effects need to be accounted for in the model. This is typically done through a process known as SGS parameterization.



There are several approaches to SGS parameterization, including the Smagorinsky model, the dynamic model, and the scale-dependent dynamic model. These models are based on the concept of eddy viscosity, which is a measure of the turbulent mixing caused by the SGS turbulence.



The Smagorinsky model, for example, assumes that the eddy viscosity is proportional to the strain rate of the resolved scales of motion. This model has been widely used in the study of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, but it has some limitations. For instance, it does not account for the scale-dependent nature of the SGS turbulence, which can lead to inaccurate predictions of the energy cascade in the turbulence.



The dynamic model addresses this issue by allowing the eddy viscosity to vary with the scale of motion. This model has been shown to provide more accurate predictions of the energy cascade in the turbulence, but it requires additional computational resources.



The scale-dependent dynamic model further improves the accuracy of the SGS parameterization by accounting for the scale-dependent nature of the energy transfer in the turbulence. This model has been used in the study of SQG turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, and it has been shown to provide accurate predictions of the energy cascade and the spectral slope of the turbulence.



In the context of the Mean-Field Approximation, the SGS parameterization can be simplified by assuming that the SGS turbulence is in a state of statistical equilibrium. This assumption allows us to express the SGS turbulence in terms of the mean field, which can be computed from the resolved scales of motion. This approach has been used in the study of SQG turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, and it has been shown to provide accurate predictions of the energy cascade and the spectral slope of the turbulence.



In the next sections, we will discuss these models in more detail and we will explore how they can be used to model SQG turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### 3.1d SQG Turbulence and Frontogenesis



In the context of Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) turbulence, frontogenesis plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of fronts, which are regions of sharp temperature gradients. The frontogenesis equation, as described in the previous section, provides a mathematical framework to study this process.



The three-dimensional form of the frontogenesis equation includes diabatic terms and deformation terms in each dimension. The diabatic terms represent the rate of change of heat in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, while the deformation terms represent the deformation of the temperature field due to the velocity field.



In the context of SQG turbulence, the frontogenesis equation can be used to study the formation and intensification of fronts. The diabatic terms can be interpreted as the heating or cooling of the fluid due to external forces, such as solar radiation or heat flux from the ocean surface. The deformation terms, on the other hand, represent the stretching and folding of the temperature field due to the turbulent motion of the fluid.



The frontogenesis process can lead to the formation of sharp temperature gradients, which can enhance the SQG turbulence. This is because the temperature gradient acts as a source of potential energy, which can be converted into kinetic energy through the process of baroclinic instability. This process can lead to the intensification of the turbulence, which can further enhance the frontogenesis process.



In the next section, we will discuss the numerical methods used to solve the frontogenesis equation in the context of SQG turbulence. We will also discuss the challenges associated with these methods and the strategies used to overcome them.



### Section: 3.2 Effective Diffusivity:



In the study of turbulence, the concept of effective diffusivity plays a crucial role. It is a measure of the rate at which a scalar quantity, such as heat or a pollutant, spreads in a turbulent flow. The effective diffusivity is influenced by both the molecular diffusivity and the turbulent mixing.



The effective diffusivity, $D_{eff}$, can be expressed as:



$$

D_{eff} = D_m + D_t

$$



where $D_m$ is the molecular diffusivity and $D_t$ is the turbulent diffusivity. The molecular diffusivity is a property of the fluid and the scalar, while the turbulent diffusivity is a property of the flow.



### Subsection: 3.2a Mixing and Diffusion in Turbulent Flows



The process of mixing and diffusion in turbulent flows is complex and not fully understood. However, recent advances in experimental techniques and numerical simulations have provided new insights into this process.



One of the key findings is that the mixing and diffusion in turbulent flows is highly intermittent. This means that the mixing and diffusion occur in bursts, rather than continuously. This intermittent behavior is related to the structure of the turbulence, which is characterized by a hierarchy of eddies of different sizes.



The large-scale eddies are responsible for the transport of the scalar over large distances, while the small-scale eddies are responsible for the mixing and diffusion at the molecular level. This multi-scale process is often referred to as the turbulent cascade.



The effective diffusivity in a turbulent flow can be significantly larger than the molecular diffusivity, due to the action of the turbulent eddies. This is particularly important in the atmosphere and the ocean, where the turbulent mixing plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, moisture, and pollutants.



Recent advances in non-intrusive experimental techniques, such as Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), have provided new insights into the mixing and diffusion in turbulent flows. These techniques allow for the measurement of the concentration and velocity fields with high spatial and temporal resolution, which is crucial for the study of the turbulent cascade.



In the next section, we will discuss the mathematical models used to describe the mixing and diffusion in turbulent flows, and the challenges associated with these models.



#### 3.2b Effective Diffusivity in the Ocean and Atmosphere



The role of effective diffusivity in the ocean and atmosphere is of paramount importance, particularly in the context of climate change and global warming. As we have seen, the effective diffusivity, $D_{eff}$, is a measure of the rate at which a scalar quantity spreads in a turbulent flow, and is influenced by both the molecular diffusivity and the turbulent mixing.



In the ocean, the process of eddy diffusion is responsible for the constant mixing observed across ocean basins. Eddy activity, which ranges from Kolmogorov microscales to gyres spanning entire basins, dissipates energy continuously, which is balanced mainly by tides and wind stress. This turbulent mixing, enabled by eddy diffusion, plays a crucial role in the transport of heat and salt across the global ocean.



The efficiency of turbulent mixing in sub-Antarctic regions is a key element which sets the rate of the overturning circulation. This circulation is responsible for the vertical transport of water masses, and thus the transport of heat and salt across the global ocean. Eddy diffusion also controls the upwelling of atmospheric carbon dissolved in the upper ocean thousands of years prior, and thus plays an important role in Earth's climate system.



In the atmosphere, the turbulent mixing plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, moisture, and pollutants. The effective diffusivity in a turbulent flow can be significantly larger than the molecular diffusivity, due to the action of the turbulent eddies. This is particularly important in the atmosphere, where the turbulent mixing plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, moisture, and pollutants.



Recent advances in non-intrusive experimental techniques, such as Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), have provided new insights into the process of mixing and diffusion in turbulent flows. These techniques have revealed that the mixing and diffusion in turbulent flows is highly intermittent, occurring in bursts rather than continuously. This intermittent behavior is related to the structure of the turbulence, which is characterized by a hierarchy of eddies of different sizes.



In conclusion, the concept of effective diffusivity is crucial in understanding the transport processes in the ocean and atmosphere. It provides a measure of the rate at which scalar quantities, such as heat, moisture, pollutants, and carbon, spread in a turbulent flow. Understanding this process is of paramount importance in the context of climate change and global warming.



#### 3.2c Parameterization of Effective Diffusivity



The parameterization of effective diffusivity is a crucial step in understanding and predicting the behavior of turbulent flows in the ocean and atmosphere. This parameterization is typically achieved through the use of turbulence closure models, which aim to describe the effects of turbulence on the mean flow.



One of the most common approaches to parameterizing effective diffusivity is through the use of the eddy diffusivity model. This model assumes that the turbulent flux of a scalar quantity is proportional to the mean gradient of that quantity, with the proportionality constant being the eddy diffusivity, $K$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:



$$

\overline{v'c'} = -K \frac{\partial \overline{c}}{\partial z}

$$



where $\overline{v'c'}$ is the turbulent flux, $\overline{c}$ is the mean concentration of the scalar quantity, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate.



The eddy diffusivity model is a simplification of the turbulent diffusion process, and it assumes that the turbulence is isotropic and homogeneous. However, in the ocean and atmosphere, turbulence is often anisotropic and inhomogeneous, which can lead to inaccuracies in the model.



To account for these complexities, more advanced turbulence closure models have been developed. These models, such as the $k$-$\epsilon$ model and the Reynolds stress model, incorporate additional parameters to better represent the effects of turbulence on the mean flow. These models are typically more computationally intensive than the eddy diffusivity model, but they can provide a more accurate representation of the turbulent diffusion process.



In the context of climate modeling, the parameterization of effective diffusivity is a critical component in predicting the transport of heat, moisture, and pollutants in the ocean and atmosphere. As such, ongoing research is focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of these parameterizations.



#### 3.2d Applications of Effective Diffusivity



The concept of effective diffusivity has a wide range of applications in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. It is particularly useful in understanding and predicting the transport of scalar quantities such as heat, moisture, and pollutants in these turbulent flows.



One of the key applications of effective diffusivity is in the field of climate modeling. The transport of heat and moisture in the ocean and atmosphere plays a crucial role in determining the Earth's climate. By accurately parameterizing effective diffusivity, climate models can better predict the distribution of these quantities and thus provide more accurate forecasts of future climate conditions.



For instance, the effective diffusivity can be used to model the spread of pollutants in the atmosphere. By understanding how turbulence affects the diffusion of pollutants, we can predict their dispersion patterns and concentrations, which is crucial for air quality management and public health.



In oceanography, effective diffusivity is used to study the mixing and transport of heat, salt, and other tracers in the ocean. This is important for understanding ocean circulation patterns, which have significant impacts on global climate.



Moreover, effective diffusivity is also applied in the field of fluid dynamics, particularly in the study of turbulent flows. It is used to model the transport of momentum, heat, and mass in turbulent flows, which is essential for the design and analysis of various engineering systems, such as aircraft, ships, and power plants.



In summary, the concept of effective diffusivity is a powerful tool in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. It provides a means to quantify the effects of turbulence on the transport of scalar quantities, which is crucial for a wide range of applications, from climate modeling to engineering design. As such, ongoing research is focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of effective diffusivity parameterizations, with the aim of enhancing our ability to predict and manage the impacts of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 3.3 Transformed Eulerian Mean



#### 3.3a Basic Concepts of Transformed Eulerian Mean



The Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) is a mathematical framework used to understand the effects of wave-mean flow interactions in the ocean and atmosphere. It is particularly useful in the study of turbulence, as it provides a means to quantify the effects of eddy-induced transport on the mean flow.



The TEM is derived from the Eulerian mean, which is the average of a quantity over a period of time at a fixed point in space. However, the Eulerian mean can be misleading in the presence of waves, as it does not account for the phase speed of the waves. The TEM corrects for this by transforming the reference frame to move with the phase speed of the waves.



The basic concept of the TEM can be understood in terms of directional statistics. Given a set of "N" measurements $z_n=e^{i\theta_n}$, the mean value of "z" is defined as:



$$

\overline{z}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N z_n

$$



which may be expressed as



$$

\overline{z} = \overline{C} + i\overline{S}

$$



where



$$

\overline{C} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(\theta_n) \text{ and } \overline{S} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \sin(\theta_n)

$$



or, alternatively as:



$$

\overline{z} = \overline{R}e^{i\overline{\theta}}

$$



where



$$

\overline{R} = \sqrt{\overline{C}^2+{\overline{S}}^2} \text{ and } \overline{\theta} = \arctan (\overline{S} / \overline{C}).

$$



The distribution of the mean angle ($\overline{\theta}$) for a circular pdf "P"("θ") will be given by:



$$

P(\overline{C},\overline{S}) \, d\overline{C} \, d\overline{S} =

P(\overline{R},\overline{\theta}) \, d\overline{R} \, d\overline{\theta} = 

\int_\Gamma \cdots \int_\Gamma \prod_{n=1}^N \left[ P(\theta_n) \, d\theta_n \right]

$$



where $\Gamma$ is over any interval of length $2\pi$ and the integral is subject to the constraint that $\overline{S}$ and $\overline{C}$ are constant, or, alternatively, that $\overline{R}$ and $\overline{\theta}$ are constant.



The TEM is a powerful tool in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. It provides a means to quantify the effects of wave-mean flow interactions on the mean flow, which is crucial for a wide range of applications, from climate modeling to engineering design. As such, ongoing research is focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of the TEM.



#### 3.3b Transformed Eulerian Mean in 2D Flows



In the context of two-dimensional (2D) flows, the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework becomes particularly insightful. The 2D nature of the flow simplifies the mathematical representation, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of the underlying physics.



The TEM in 2D flows can be described using the stream function $\psi$ and the vorticity $\omega$, which are related by the Poisson equation:



$$

\nabla^2 \psi = -\omega

$$



The vorticity equation in 2D flows can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t} + J(\psi, \omega) = \nu \nabla^2 \omega

$$



where $J(\psi, \omega)$ is the Jacobian determinant representing the advection of vorticity, and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.



In the presence of waves, the vorticity field can be decomposed into a mean part $\overline{\omega}$ and a fluctuating part $\omega'$, such that $\omega = \overline{\omega} + \omega'$. The mean vorticity equation then becomes:



$$

\frac{\partial \overline{\omega}}{\partial t} + J(\overline{\psi}, \overline{\omega}) = \nu \nabla^2 \overline{\omega} - \overline{J(\psi', \omega')}

$$



The last term on the right-hand side represents the wave-induced vorticity flux divergence, which is the key feature of the TEM framework in 2D flows. This term quantifies the effect of wave-mean flow interactions on the mean vorticity, and thus on the mean flow itself.



In the context of turbulence, the wave-induced vorticity flux divergence can be interpreted as the eddy vorticity flux, which plays a crucial role in the energy cascade and the generation of turbulence.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of the TEM framework for the study of turbulence in 2D flows, with a particular focus on the role of wave-mean flow interactions and eddy vorticity fluxes.



#### 3.3c Transformed Eulerian Mean in 3D Flows



In three-dimensional (3D) flows, the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework becomes more complex due to the additional dimension. However, it also provides a more comprehensive understanding of the turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



The TEM in 3D flows can be described using the velocity vector $\mathbf{u}$ and the vorticity vector $\mathbf{\omega}$, which are related by the curl operation:



$$

\mathbf{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{u}

$$



The vorticity equation in 3D flows can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial \mathbf{\omega}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{\omega} = \mathbf{\omega} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{\omega}

$$



where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.



Similar to the 2D case, the vorticity field can be decomposed into a mean part $\overline{\mathbf{\omega}}$ and a fluctuating part $\mathbf{\omega'}$, such that $\mathbf{\omega} = \overline{\mathbf{\omega}} + \mathbf{\omega'}$. The mean vorticity equation then becomes:



$$

\frac{\partial \overline{\mathbf{\omega}}}{\partial t} + \overline{\mathbf{u}} \cdot \nabla \overline{\mathbf{\omega}} = \overline{\mathbf{\omega}} \cdot \nabla \overline{\mathbf{u}} + \nu \nabla^2 \overline{\mathbf{\omega}} - \overline{\mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{\omega'}}

$$



The last term on the right-hand side represents the wave-induced vorticity flux divergence in 3D, which is the key feature of the TEM framework in 3D flows. This term quantifies the effect of wave-mean flow interactions on the mean vorticity, and thus on the mean flow itself.



In the context of turbulence, the wave-induced vorticity flux divergence can be interpreted as the eddy vorticity flux, which plays a crucial role in the energy cascade and the generation of turbulence.



In the following sections, we will explore the implications of the TEM framework for the study of turbulence in 3D flows, with a particular focus on the role of wave-mean flow interactions and eddy vorticity fluxes. We will also discuss the application of the mean-field approximation in the context of 3D turbulence, and how it can be used to simplify the analysis of complex turbulent flows.



#### 3.3d Applications of Transformed Eulerian Mean



The Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework, as discussed in the previous sections, provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of turbulence in both the ocean and atmosphere. In this section, we will delve into some of the applications of the TEM, particularly in the context of 3D flows.



One of the key applications of the TEM framework is in the study of the energy cascade in turbulent flows. As we have seen, the wave-induced vorticity flux divergence, represented by the term $\overline{\mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{\omega'}}$ in the mean vorticity equation, plays a crucial role in this process. This term quantifies the effect of wave-mean flow interactions on the mean vorticity, and thus on the mean flow itself. By studying this term, we can gain insights into the mechanisms of energy transfer in turbulence, from the large scales where energy is injected into the system, to the small scales where it is dissipated.



Another important application of the TEM framework is in the study of the role of rotation in turbulent flows. The rotation matrix and the Euler axis/angle, as discussed in the related context, provide a mathematical framework for describing rotations in 3D space. In the context of the TEM, these tools can be used to describe the rotation of the mean flow and the vorticity vector, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of rotating turbulence.



The TEM framework can also be applied to the study of the effects of viscosity on turbulence. The term $\nu \nabla^2 \overline{\mathbf{\omega}}$ in the mean vorticity equation represents the viscous diffusion of vorticity. By studying this term, we can understand how viscosity affects the distribution of vorticity in the flow, and thus the dynamics of turbulence.



In conclusion, the TEM framework provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. By studying the various terms in the mean vorticity equation, we can gain insights into the mechanisms of energy transfer, the role of rotation, and the effects of viscosity in turbulent flows. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, providing a comprehensive understanding of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 3.4 Transformed Eulerian Mean in 3D:



#### 3.4a Transformed Eulerian Mean Equations



The Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) equations in 3D are a set of equations that describe the mean flow in a turbulent system. These equations are derived from the primitive equations, which are a set of non-linear differential equations that describe the motion of fluid in the atmosphere and ocean. The TEM equations are obtained by applying a transformation to the primitive equations, which simplifies the description of the mean flow.



The TEM equations in 3D can be written as follows:



$$

\begin{aligned}

\frac{\partial \overline{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t} + \overline{\mathbf{u}} \cdot \nabla \overline{\mathbf{u}} &= -\nabla \overline{p} + \nu \nabla^2 \overline{\mathbf{u}} + \overline{\mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'}}, \\

\frac{\partial \overline{\mathbf{\omega}}}{\partial t} + \overline{\mathbf{u}} \cdot \nabla \overline{\mathbf{\omega}} &= \nabla \times \left( \overline{\mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'}} \right) + \nu \nabla^2 \overline{\mathbf{\omega}},

\end{aligned}

$$



where $\overline{\mathbf{u}}$ is the mean velocity, $\overline{p}$ is the mean pressure, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $\overline{\mathbf{\omega}}$ is the mean vorticity, and $\overline{\mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'}}$ is the Reynolds stress tensor.



The first equation is the mean momentum equation, which describes the evolution of the mean velocity. The second equation is the mean vorticity equation, which describes the evolution of the mean vorticity. The Reynolds stress tensor represents the effect of the turbulent fluctuations on the mean flow.



The TEM equations in 3D provide a comprehensive description of the mean flow in a turbulent system. They allow us to study the dynamics of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, including the energy cascade, the role of rotation, and the effects of viscosity. In the following sections, we will delve into the details of these equations and their applications.



#### 3.4b Turbulence Closure Models



Turbulence closure models are essential in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. These models provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex interactions between turbulent fluctuations and the mean flow. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used turbulence closure models, including the Spalart–Allmaras (S–A), "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon), and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models.



The Spalart–Allmaras (S–A) model is a one-equation model that provides a relatively low-cost computation for the turbulence viscosity, denoted as $\nu_t$. This model is particularly useful in aerodynamic applications, where it can accurately predict the onset and development of turbulence in boundary layers.



The "k"–ε and "k"–ω models are two-equation models that also employ the Boussinesq hypothesis for turbulence viscosity. The "k"–ε model is widely used in engineering applications due to its robustness and simplicity. It involves two transport equations: one for the turbulent kinetic energy "k" and another for the turbulent dissipation rate "ε".



The "k"–ω model, on the other hand, solves two transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy "k" and the specific dissipation rate "ω". This model is particularly effective in near-wall turbulence modeling, where it can accurately capture the behavior of the turbulent boundary layer.



These models are commonly employed in modern engineering applications, including the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) pressure-stabilizing Petrov–Galerkin (PSPG) formulation for incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The SUPG-PSPG stabilization introduces additional terms into the Navier–Stokes equations to stabilize the solution and improve its accuracy.



The turbulence closure models provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex interactions between turbulent fluctuations and the mean flow. They are essential tools in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, allowing us to predict the behavior of turbulent systems and understand the underlying physical processes. In the following sections, we will delve into the details of these models and explore their applications in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### 3.4c Tidal Mixing and Turbulence in Estuaries



Estuaries, particularly small ones like Eprapah Creek, present unique challenges and opportunities for the study of turbulence and turbulent mixing. The field studies conducted between 2003 and 2007 in Eprapah Creek estuary provided valuable insights into the turbulence and turbulent mixing properties in small estuaries. 



The studies revealed that the turbulence and water quality properties responded distinctly under spring and neap tidal forcing and behaved differently in the middle and upper estuarine zones. This behavior of turbulence properties to spring tidal forcing differed from that observed in larger estuaries and seemed unique to small estuarine systems. 



The investigation of several key turbulence parameters used in the modelling of estuarine mixing showed that many assumptions used in larger estuaries must be applied with caution or are simply untrue in small estuaries. For instance, the assumption that the mixing coefficient parameters are constant over the tidal cycle in a small estuary is simply untrue. 



These findings underscore the importance of continued study of small estuaries to better understand their unique turbulence and mixing properties. 



In small subtropical estuaries like Eprapah Creek, short-lived freshwater flushing is a common characteristic. A recent field study highlighted the short-term impact of a rainstorm on a small subtropical estuary. The flushing appeared to be caused primarily by the rainfall runoff from the nearby shopping centres, parkings and roadways. In the estuary, the surface flows were dominated by the freshwater flushing including during the flood tide. 



The turbulence closure models discussed in the previous section, such as the Spalart–Allmaras (S–A), "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon), and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models, can be applied to understand the complex interactions between turbulent fluctuations and the mean flow in estuaries. However, these models must be applied with caution, considering the unique characteristics of small estuaries. 



In the next section, we will discuss the application of these turbulence closure models in the context of small estuaries, and how they can be adapted to better represent the unique turbulence and mixing properties observed in these systems.



#### 3.4d Submesoscale Processes in 3D Turbulence



Submesoscale processes are a critical component of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence. These processes, which occur at scales of 1-10 km, are responsible for a significant portion of the energy transfer from large-scale to small-scale motions in the ocean and atmosphere. They are characterized by strong horizontal density gradients and vertical velocities, and their dynamics are largely influenced by the Earth's rotation and stratification.



The study of submesoscale processes in 3D turbulence is a complex task due to the wide range of scales involved and the nonlinearity of the governing equations. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, which are commonly used in turbulence modeling, introduce additional variables at each level of the averaging procedure, leading to the so-called closure problem. This problem necessitates the use of subgridscale (SGS) parameterization schemes to account for the effects of unresolved scales.



In the ocean, submesoscale processes are often associated with frontal systems, where strong horizontal density gradients lead to intense vertical velocities. These processes play a crucial role in the vertical transport of heat, salt, and nutrients, thereby influencing the ocean's general circulation and biological productivity. 



In the atmosphere, submesoscale processes are typically associated with convective systems and boundary layer turbulence. They are responsible for the vertical transport of heat, moisture, and momentum, and they play a crucial role in cloud formation and precipitation.



The study of submesoscale processes in 3D turbulence is a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing advancements in numerical modeling and observational techniques. High-resolution numerical simulations are increasingly being used to study these processes, and they have provided valuable insights into their dynamics and their role in the energy cascade. At the same time, new observational techniques, such as satellite remote sensing and autonomous underwater vehicles, are providing unprecedented data on submesoscale processes in the ocean and atmosphere.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the dynamics of submesoscale processes, their role in the energy cascade, and the techniques used to study them. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in the study of submesoscale processes in 3D turbulence.



### Conclusion



Throughout this chapter, we have delved into the complexities of the Mean-Field Approximation and its application in understanding turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. We have explored the mathematical foundations of this approximation, and how it simplifies the study of turbulent systems by reducing the complexity of the interactions between individual particles or fluid elements. 



The Mean-Field Approximation has been shown to be a powerful tool in the study of turbulence, providing a framework for understanding the large-scale behavior of turbulent systems. By focusing on the average behavior of the system, rather than the behavior of individual elements, we can gain insights into the overall dynamics of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. 



However, it is important to remember that the Mean-Field Approximation is just that - an approximation. While it provides a useful simplification, it does not capture all the intricacies of turbulent systems. Future research will continue to refine our understanding of turbulence, and the role of the Mean-Field Approximation within this field of study.

## Chapter 4: Particle Motions



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and fascinating phenomenon, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. This chapter, "Particle Motions", delves into the intricate dance of particles as they move within these turbulent environments. 



Turbulence is often visualized as a chaotic, disordered system, but it is, in fact, a highly structured and organized process. It is characterized by eddies of different sizes interacting with each other, transferring energy from larger to smaller scales in a process known as the energy cascade. This energy cascade is a fundamental aspect of turbulence and has a profound impact on the motion of particles.



Particles in a turbulent flow do not simply follow the fluid motion. Their trajectories are influenced by a variety of factors, including their size, shape, and density relative to the fluid, as well as the characteristics of the turbulence itself. Understanding these influences is crucial for predicting particle behavior in a range of applications, from predicting the spread of pollutants in the atmosphere to understanding the distribution of plankton in the ocean.



In this chapter, we will explore the theory of particle motion in turbulent flows, drawing on concepts from fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, and chaos theory. We will examine the forces acting on particles in a turbulent flow and discuss how these forces influence particle trajectories. We will also look at the role of turbulence in mixing and dispersion, and how this affects the distribution of particles in the ocean and atmosphere.



The study of particle motions in turbulence is a rich and complex field, with many open questions and exciting areas of research. This chapter aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding this topic, and to inspire further exploration and study.



### Section: 4.1 Stokes’ Drift:



#### 4.1a Definition and Mechanisms of Stokes' Drift



Stokes' drift, named after George Gabriel Stokes who first derived expressions for this drift in his 1847 study of water waves, is a nonlinear phenomenon that occurs in fluid dynamics. It is the average velocity of a fluid parcel as it travels with the fluid flow in a pure wave motion. For example, a particle floating at the free surface of water waves experiences a net Stokes drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation.



More specifically, the Stokes drift velocity is the difference between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid at a fixed position. This difference in end positions, after a predefined amount of time (usually one wave period), is derived from a description in the Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates. The end position in the Lagrangian description is obtained by following a specific fluid parcel during the time interval, while the corresponding end position in the Eulerian description is obtained by integrating the flow velocity at a fixed position—equal to the initial position in the Lagrangian description—during the same time interval.



Mathematically, the Stokes drift velocity ($V_s$) can be defined as:



$$

V_s = \frac{Stokes \, drift}{time \, interval}

$$



Often, the term Stokes drift is loosely used to refer to Stokes drift velocity. Stokes drift may occur in all instances of oscillatory flow which are inhomogeneous in space, such as in water waves, tides, and atmospheric waves.



In the Lagrangian description, fluid parcels may drift far from their initial positions. Defining an average Lagrangian velocity and Stokes drift velocity that can be attributed to a certain fixed position is not a trivial task. However, the "Generalized Lagrangian Mean" (GLM) theory of Andrews and McIntyre in 1978 provides an unambiguous description.



Stokes drift plays a significant role in the mass transfer of various kinds of material. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for predicting particle behavior in a range of applications, from predicting the spread of pollutants in the atmosphere to understanding the distribution of plankton in the ocean. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical derivation of Stokes' drift and its implications in oceanic and atmospheric turbulence.



#### 4.1b Particle Trajectories in Turbulent Flows



Turbulent flows, characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity, significantly influence the trajectories of particles in the ocean and atmosphere. The complexity of these flows is due to the presence of a wide range of length and time scales, which makes the prediction of particle trajectories a challenging task.



In turbulent flows, particles are subjected to a random walk due to the fluctuating fluid velocity, leading to dispersion or spreading of particles. This dispersion is often modeled using the concept of turbulent diffusion. However, this approach is only valid for particles that are small enough to follow the fluid motion instantaneously (i.e., the particle response time is much smaller than the smallest time scale of the turbulence), and for particles that do not affect the fluid motion (i.e., the particle mass loading is small).



For larger particles, or particles with significant inertia, the particle response time becomes comparable to or larger than some of the time scales of the turbulence. In this case, the particles can no longer follow the fluid motion instantaneously, leading to a phenomenon known as preferential concentration. Particles tend to accumulate in regions of high shear and low vorticity, such as turbulent boundary layers. This phenomenon is not well understood and is difficult to capture using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large eddy simulation (LES) models, as too much time-varying information is lost.



Particles in turbulent flows also exhibit a behavior known as turbophoresis, where they migrate down turbulence intensity gradients. This behavior is particularly challenging to model due to the complex interplay between the particles and the turbulent flow.



Mathematically, the trajectory of a particle in a turbulent flow can be described by the following stochastic differential equation:



$$

\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t) + \sqrt{2K}\mathbf{W}(t)

$$



where $\mathbf{x}$ is the particle position, $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the fluid velocity at the particle position, $K$ is the turbulent diffusion coefficient, and $\mathbf{W}(t)$ is a Wiener process representing the random walk of the particle due to turbulence.



In conclusion, the prediction of particle trajectories in turbulent flows is a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of both the fluid dynamics and the particle behavior. Despite the challenges, significant progress has been made in recent years, and this remains an active area of research.



#### 4.1c Lagrangian Coherent Structures



Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) are a concept that has emerged in the study of fluid dynamics to describe the coherent patterns that emerge in the chaotic motion of particles in turbulent flows. These structures are material surfaces in the phase space that exert a sustained and consistent action on nearby trajectories throughout a given time interval. This action can take the form of attraction, repulsion, or shear, and it is this action that creates coherent patterns out of randomly selected nearby initial conditions.



Mathematically, an LCS can be defined as a material surface $\mathcal M(t)$ in the phase space $\mathcal P$ that is mapped by the flow map $F^t_{t_0}$ from its initial conditions $\mathcal M(t_0)$ to its position at any time $t \in \mathcal I$. If the flow map $F^t_{t_0}$ is a diffeomorphism for any choice of $t \in \mathcal I$, then the set



$$

\mathcal M = \{ (x,t) \in \mathcal P \times \mathcal I : x = F^t_{t_0}(x_0) \text{ for some } x_0 \in \mathcal M(t_0) \}

$$



is an invariant manifold in the extended phase space $\mathcal P \times \mathcal I$. This invariant manifold, or LCS, acts as a core of coherent trajectory patterns in the turbulent flow.



The concept of LCSs is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of particles in turbulent flows. As we have seen in the previous section, particles in turbulent flows exhibit complex behaviors such as preferential concentration and turbophoresis, which are difficult to capture using traditional modeling approaches. LCSs provide a framework for understanding these behaviors by identifying the coherent structures that guide the motion of particles in the flow.



In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical properties of LCSs and explore how they can be identified and characterized in turbulent flows. We will also discuss how the concept of LCSs can be applied to understand and predict the behavior of particles in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 4.1 Stokes’ Drift:



Stokes' drift, also known as wave-induced mass transport, is a phenomenon that describes the net movement of particles in a fluid due to the passage of waves. This drift is named after George Gabriel Stokes, who first derived the wave-induced horizontal particle velocity in a linear wave field in 1847.



#### 4.1d Observations and Modeling of Stokes' Drift



The Stokes' drift velocity, $U_s$, can be expressed as:



$$

U_s = \frac{1}{16} \frac{H^2}{T} \exp \left( \frac{-2kz}{\sinh(2kd)} \right)

$$



where $H$ is the wave height, $T$ is the wave period, $k$ is the wave number, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), and $d$ is the water depth.



The Stokes' drift has significant implications for the transport of buoyant particles, such as plankton, in the ocean. It also plays a crucial role in the formation of Langmuir circulation, a type of turbulence that occurs in the ocean and affects the distribution of these particles.



Observations of Stokes' drift in the ocean are challenging due to the difficulty in separating the wave-induced motion from the mean flow. However, recent advances in technology, such as the use of high-frequency radar and satellite altimetry, have allowed for more accurate measurements of wave characteristics, which can be used to estimate Stokes' drift.



Modeling Stokes' drift is also complex due to the non-linear interactions between waves and currents. However, several models have been developed to predict Stokes' drift based on wave characteristics and water depth. These models are crucial for understanding and predicting the transport of particles in the ocean and the atmosphere.



In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical properties of Stokes' drift and explore how it can be identified and characterized in turbulent flows. We will also discuss how the concept of Stokes' drift can be applied to understand and predict the behavior of particles in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 4.2 Baroclinic Turbulence:



Baroclinic turbulence is a type of turbulence that arises due to the instability in the density stratification of a fluid. This instability, known as baroclinic instability, is a key driver of turbulence in both the ocean and the atmosphere. 



#### 4.2a Baroclinic Instability and Turbulence



Baroclinic instability is a fundamental process in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. It arises when there is a misalignment between the density gradient and the pressure gradient in a fluid. This misalignment can lead to the growth of perturbations, which can eventually lead to the development of turbulence.



The mathematical description of baroclinic instability involves the use of the quasi-geostrophic approximation, which simplifies the equations of motion by assuming that the horizontal scales of motion are much larger than the vertical scales. This approximation allows us to separate the geostrophic flow components, $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$, from the ageostrophic flow components, $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$.



The quasi-geostrophic approximation also allows us to derive the equations for the ageostrophic velocity components, $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$, in terms of the geostrophic flow components and the topography of the fluid surface, $\eta$:



$$

\tilde{v} = -\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]

\tilde{u} = -\frac{g}{f_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x \partial t}

$$



These equations show that the ageostrophic velocity components are driven by the rate of change of the topography of the fluid surface. This implies that any changes in the topography can lead to the development of ageostrophic flow, which can in turn lead to the development of baroclinic instability and turbulence.



In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical properties of baroclinic turbulence and explore how it can be identified and characterized in turbulent flows. We will also discuss how the concept of baroclinic turbulence can be applied to understand and predict the behavior of particles in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### 4.2b Eddy-Driven Ocean and Atmosphere Circulation



Eddy-driven circulation is a significant component of the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. Eddies, which are essentially turbulent fluid motions, play a crucial role in the transport of heat, momentum, and other properties in both the ocean and the atmosphere. 



##### Eddy Saturation and Eddy Compensation



Eddy saturation and eddy compensation are two key concepts in the study of eddy-driven circulation. Eddy saturation refers to the insensitivity of the mean current to the accelerating wind forcing, while eddy compensation refers to the near independence of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) to the increase of wind stress. 



The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is a prime example of a system that is fully eddy saturated but only partially eddy compensated. This means that while the mean current of the ACC is insensitive to changes in wind forcing, the MOC associated with the ACC is not entirely independent of wind stress. 



It is important to note that eddy saturation and eddy compensation are distinct dynamical mechanisms, and the occurrence of one does not necessarily entail the occurrence of the other. The degree to which there is eddy compensation in the Southern Ocean is currently unknown and is a topic of ongoing research.



##### Eddy-Driven Models and Sensitivity



Eddy permitting and eddy resolving models are used to examine the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC. These models are of great importance in understanding the dynamics of eddy-driven circulation, as they allow for the examination of the sensitivity of the transport in the ACC and MOC to changes in wind stress and other factors.



However, the resolution of these models is a critical factor in their effectiveness. Ocean observations do not have a high enough resolution to fully estimate the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation. Idealized studies show that the MOC response is more sensitive to model resolution than the ACC transport. 



##### MOC Observations



Observations of the MOC, such as those conducted by Kanzow and colleagues (2007), have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of eddy-driven circulation. These observations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the array and reported that the sum of the transports into the MOC is a critical factor in understanding the dynamics of eddy-driven circulation.



In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical properties of eddy-driven circulation and explore how it can be identified and characterized in turbulent flows. We will also discuss how the concept of eddy saturation and eddy compensation can be applied to the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 4.2 Baroclinic Turbulence:



#### 4.2c Mixing and Energy Dissipation in Baroclinic Turbulence



Baroclinic turbulence is a significant factor in the mixing and energy dissipation in the ocean and atmosphere. It is a form of turbulence that arises due to the density stratification in a rotating fluid system, such as the ocean or the atmosphere. 



##### Mixing in Baroclinic Turbulence



Mixing in baroclinic turbulence is a complex process that involves the interaction of various scales of motion. The large-scale motions in the ocean interact with other scales through the nonlinearities in the primitive equations. This interaction leads to the Reynolds averaging procedure, which results in new variables arising at each level. This necessitates the use of a parameterization scheme to account for the subgrid scale effects.



The subgridscale (SGS) mixing schemes are a crucial part of this parameterization. These schemes are used to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary. Special dynamical parameterizations, such as topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion, and convection, are becoming available for certain processes. 



In the vertical, the surface mixed layer (sml) has historically received special attention due to its important role in air-sea exchange. Various schemes are now available to model the mixing in this layer.



##### Energy Dissipation in Baroclinic Turbulence



Energy dissipation in baroclinic turbulence is primarily due to the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. This conversion occurs when the baroclinic instability leads to the growth of eddies, which then break down and dissipate their energy.



The energy dissipation rate in baroclinic turbulence is a key parameter in understanding the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. It is also a critical factor in the parameterization of subgrid scale processes in ocean general circulation models.



However, accurately estimating the energy dissipation rate in baroclinic turbulence is a challenging task. It requires high-resolution observations and sophisticated numerical models. Ongoing research is focused on improving these estimates and understanding their implications for the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere.



In conclusion, baroclinic turbulence plays a crucial role in the mixing and energy dissipation in the ocean and atmosphere. Understanding these processes is essential for accurately modeling the dynamics of these systems and predicting their future behavior.



#### 4.2d Climate Impacts of Baroclinic Turbulence



Baroclinic turbulence plays a significant role in the climate system, particularly in the context of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). 



##### Impact on Meridional Overturning Circulation



The MOC is a critical component of the Earth's climate system, transporting heat from the equator towards the poles. Baroclinic turbulence, through its role in mixing and energy dissipation, can influence the strength and variability of the MOC. 



As Kanzow et al. (2007) and Cunningham et al. (2007) demonstrated, the MOC exhibits significant variability on annual scales, with a root-mean-square value of 3.4 Sv and a year-long average MOC of 18.7 ± 5.6 Sv. This variability is largely driven by changes in the strength of the MOC, which Johns et al. (2009) found to be highly correlated with changes in meridional heat transport. 



Baroclinic turbulence, through its impact on the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy and the subsequent growth and dissipation of eddies, can influence these changes in MOC strength. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of baroclinic turbulence is crucial for predicting changes in the MOC and, by extension, the Earth's climate system.



##### Impact on the Atmospheric Boundary Layer



The ABL is the lowest part of the atmosphere and is directly influenced by the Earth's surface. It plays a crucial role in the exchange of heat, moisture, and momentum between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. 



Modeling the ABL is a complex task due to the variety of surface forcings and the small spatial and temporal scales at which these forcings occur. Baroclinic turbulence, through its role in mixing, can influence the representation of these forcings in global climate models (GCMs). 



In particular, the parameterization of subgrid scale processes, which is necessary to account for the effects of small-scale noise, is heavily influenced by the dynamics of baroclinic turbulence. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of baroclinic turbulence can improve the accuracy of ABL representations in GCMs, leading to more accurate climate predictions.



In conclusion, baroclinic turbulence plays a significant role in the Earth's climate system, influencing both the MOC and the ABL. Understanding the dynamics of baroclinic turbulence is therefore crucial for predicting changes in the Earth's climate system.



### 4.3 Gyres



Gyres are large systems of circulating ocean currents, often spanning thousands of kilometers across. They are driven by the Coriolis effect and wind patterns, and are also influenced by the Earth's rotation. Gyres play a crucial role in the global climate system, transporting heat and nutrients around the world's oceans.



#### 4.3a Oceanic and Atmospheric Gyres



Oceanic gyres are large systems of circular ocean currents formed by global wind patterns and the forces resulting from the Earth's rotation. The movement of these gyres helps to regulate the Earth's climate by distributing heat around the globe. 



In the Atlantic Ocean, there are two primary gyres: the North Atlantic Gyre and the South Atlantic Gyre. The North Atlantic Gyre, a clockwise warm-water gyre, occupies the northern Atlantic, while the counter-clockwise warm-water South Atlantic Gyre appears in the southern Atlantic. 



The North Atlantic Gyre's surface circulation is dominated by three interconnected currents: the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic Current, and the Subpolar Front. These currents transport warm water into the North Atlantic, significantly influencing temperatures in the North Atlantic and Europe. 



North of the North Atlantic Gyre, the cyclonic North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre plays a key role in climate variability. Unlike the North Atlantic Gyre, which is primarily steered by wind, the Subpolar Gyre is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography, both in the deep ocean and at sea level. 



The Subpolar Gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation. Its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the North Atlantic Current, which transport warm, saline waters from the subtropics to the north-eastern Atlantic. This water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of Greenland. These currents form an intense current which flows around the continental margins of the Labrador Sea. A third of this water becomes part of the deep portion of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), which feeds the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). 



The MOC, as discussed in the previous section, is a critical component of the Earth's climate system, transporting heat from the equator towards the poles. The MOC's northward heat transport is threatened by anthropogenic climate change. Large variations in the Subpolar Gyre on a decade-century scale, associated with the North Atlantic oscillation, are especially pronounced in Labrador Sea Water, the upper layers of the MOC. 



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the dynamics of gyres and their impact on the global climate system.



#### 4.3b Gyre Dynamics and Circulation



Gyre dynamics and circulation are complex processes that involve the interaction of various physical factors such as wind patterns, the Coriolis effect, and the Earth's rotation. These factors drive the formation and movement of gyres, which in turn influence the global climate system by redistributing heat and nutrients across the world's oceans.



The North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre (SPG) is a prime example of the intricate dynamics involved in gyre circulation. The SPG is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography, both in the deep ocean and at sea level. This gyre forms an integral part of the global thermohaline circulation, with its eastern portion comprising eddying branches of the North Atlantic Current. These branches transport warm, saline waters from the subtropics to the north-eastern Atlantic, where the water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of Greenland.



The Labrador Sea Water (LSW) is a significant component of the SPG. Characteristically fresh LSW is formed at intermediate depths by deep convection in the central Labrador Sea, particularly during winter storms. This convection, however, is not deep enough to penetrate into the North-East Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) layer, which forms the deep waters of the Labrador Sea. 



The LSW joins the NEADW to move southward out of the Labrador Sea. While the NEADW easily passes under the North Atlantic Current at the North-West Corner, some LSW is retained. This diversion and retention by the SPG explain its presence and entrainment near the Greenland-Scotland Ridge overflows. Most of the diverted LSW, however, splits off before the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone and remains in the western SPG.



The production of LSW is highly dependent on sea-air heat flux, with yearly production typically ranging from 3–9 Sv. Increased LSW production is associated with a strengthened SPG and is hypothesized to be anti-correlated with the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW). This interplay confounds any simple extension of a reduction in individual overflow waters to a reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).



The dynamics of gyres and their role in oceanic and atmospheric circulation are still subjects of ongoing research. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting future climate scenarios and developing effective strategies for climate change mitigation.



#### 4.3c Mesoscale Eddy Interactions in Gyres



Mesoscale eddies, which are circular currents of water spanning tens to hundreds of kilometers in diameter, play a significant role in the dynamics of ocean gyres. These eddies are generated by instabilities in the large-scale flow and are a primary mechanism for the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients across the ocean basins. 



In the context of gyres, eddies interact with the mean flow in complex ways, leading to phenomena such as eddy saturation and eddy compensation. Eddy saturation refers to the insensitivity of the mean current to changes in wind stress, while eddy compensation refers to the near independence of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) to the increase of wind stress. 



Eddy interactions in gyres can be studied using eddy-permitting and eddy-resolving models. These models allow for the examination of the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). However, it is important to note that the resolution of these models is crucial, as ocean observations do not have a high enough resolution to fully estimate the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation.



The interaction of eddies within gyres also has implications for the transport of heat and nutrients. For instance, in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre (SPG), eddying branches of the North Atlantic Current transport warm, saline waters from the subtropics to the north-eastern Atlantic. These eddies then interact with the mean flow, influencing the formation of the Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and the North-East Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW).



In conclusion, the study of mesoscale eddy interactions in gyres is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. These interactions not only influence the transport of heat and nutrients across the ocean basins but also have implications for the global climate system. However, further research is needed to fully understand the complex dynamics of these interactions and their implications for the Earth's climate system.



#### 4.3d Gyre Variability and Climate Change



The variability of gyres, particularly the North Atlantic Gyre, has significant implications for climate change. As previously discussed, the North Atlantic Gyre experiences seasonal changes, expanding and contracting with a seasonal variance. This gyre variability is linked to wintertime convective mixing, which leads to a seasonal variation of 8-10 °C in surface temperature and a fluctuation in the mixed layer depth between the Northern Hemisphere winter and summer seasons (Bates, 2001).



The seasonal changes in oceanic biology and vertical mixing in the North Atlantic Gyre alter the total amount of carbon dioxide in the seawater. Interannual trends have established that carbon dioxide concentrations within this gyre are increasing at a similar rate to that occurring in the atmosphere. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that the ocean is absorbing a substantial portion of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, which has implications for global warming and climate change.



The North Atlantic Gyre also undergoes temperature changes, which can influence the global climate system. For instance, warmer surface temperatures in the gyre can lead to increased evaporation, which can intensify the hydrological cycle and potentially lead to more extreme weather events. Furthermore, changes in the gyre's temperature can affect the distribution of marine species, as many species are sensitive to temperature changes.



However, it is important to note that the relationship between gyre variability and climate change is complex and not fully understood. While it is clear that gyres play a significant role in the global climate system, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which gyres influence climate change and to predict how these mechanisms might change in the future.



In conclusion, the study of gyre variability and its relationship with climate change is a crucial area of research in the field of oceanography. Understanding this relationship is not only important for predicting future climate change but also for developing strategies to mitigate its impacts.



### Section: 4.4 Turbulent Boundary Layers:



#### Subsection: 4.4a Boundary Layer Structure and Dynamics



Turbulent boundary layers are a significant aspect of fluid dynamics, particularly in the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence. These layers are characterized by chaotic and irregular fluid motion, which can significantly influence the transport of momentum, heat, and other scalar quantities.



The structure and dynamics of turbulent boundary layers can be understood through the study of the Blasius boundary layer and the Howarth transformation. 



The Blasius boundary layer, particularly the compressible variant, provides a mathematical framework for understanding the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a fluid. The equations for these conservation laws are given by:



$$

\frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (\rho v)}{\partial y} = 0,\\

\rho \left(u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) = \frac{\partial }{\partial y} \left(\mu\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right),\\

\rho \left(u \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \right) = \frac{\partial }{\partial y} \left(\frac{\mu}{Pr} \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \right) + \mu \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)^2

$$



where $Pr=c_{p_\infty}\mu_\infty/\kappa_\infty$ is the Prandtl number with suffix $\infty$ representing properties evaluated at infinity. The boundary conditions for these equations are:



$$ u = v = h - h_w(x) = 0 \ \text{for} \ y=0,$$

$$ u -U = h - h_\infty =0 \ \text{for} \ y=\infty \ \text{or} \ x=0.$$



The Howarth transformation introduces self-similar variables, which simplifies the analysis of the boundary layer. The transformation is given by:



$$\eta = \sqrt{\frac{U}{2\nu_\infty x}} \int_0^y \frac{\rho}{\rho_\infty} dy, \quad f(\eta) = \frac{\psi}{\sqrt{2\nu_\infty U x}}, \quad \tilde h(\eta) = \frac{h}{h_\infty}, \quad \tilde h_w = \frac{h_w}{h_\infty}, \quad \tilde \rho = \frac{\rho}{\rho_\infty},$$



These mathematical tools provide a foundation for understanding the structure and dynamics of turbulent boundary layers. However, the complexity of these layers, particularly in the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence, necessitates further study and research. The interplay between turbulence, particle motion, and boundary layers is a rich area of study with significant implications for our understanding of the natural world.



#### Subsection: 4.4b Turbulent Transport in the Boundary Layer



Turbulent transport in the boundary layer is a complex process that involves the movement of scalar quantities such as heat, momentum, and mass due to turbulent fluctuations. This process is crucial in the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers, where it significantly influences the distribution of these quantities.



The turbulent transport can be mathematically represented by the conservation equation for a passive scalar in the convective boundary layer (CBL). The equation is given by:



$$

\frac {\partial \bar {c}}{\partial t}=-\frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial z}

$$



where $\bar {c}$ is the mean of quantity $c$, which could be water vapor mixing ratio $q$, potential temperature $\theta$, eastward-moving $u$ and northward-moving $v$ wind speed. $\overline {w'c'}$ is the vertical turbulent flux of $c$.



This equation is derived under several approximations such as ignoring the body source, Bousinesq approximation, horizontal homogeneity, and no subsidence. The Bousinesq approximation, in particular, assumes that the density change due to pressure perturbation is negligible compared to the density change due to temperature change. This is a reasonable approximation in the CBL.



However, due to the inherent randomness of turbulence and our limited understanding of its exact physical behavior, parameterization of turbulent transport is necessary in model simulations. In the mixed layer, large eddies associated with the rise of warm air parcels transport heat from hot to cold, regardless of the local gradient of the background environment. This non-local counter-gradient transport should be properly represented in the model simulation.



Several approaches are generally followed in numerical models to obtain the vertical profiles and temporal variations of quantities in the CBL. These include the full mixing scheme, which assumes that the turbulent mixing is strong enough to maintain a uniform distribution of the scalar quantity within the mixed layer. This scheme is particularly useful in simulating the diurnal cycle of the CBL.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the parameterization schemes for turbulent transport in the boundary layer and discuss their applications in numerical models.



#### Subsection: 4.4c Mixing and Entrainment Processes



In the turbulent boundary layer, mixing and entrainment processes play a significant role in the transport of scalar quantities such as heat, momentum, and mass. These processes are particularly important in the context of oceanic and atmospheric convection, where they contribute to the formation and evolution of convective plumes and chimneys.



Convective plumes, as described in the previous context, act as conduits or mixing agents. When acting as conduits, they transport cooled and dense surface water downward, contributing to the renewal of water at lower depths. As mixing agents, they cool and mix a patch of water, creating a dense homogeneous cylinder, like a chimney, which ultimately collapses and adjusts under planetary rotation and gravity.



The mixing process can be mathematically represented by the following equation:



$$

\frac {\partial \bar {c}}{\partial t}=-\frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial z} + \frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial x}

$$



where $\bar {c}$ is the mean of quantity $c$, which could be water vapor mixing ratio $q$, potential temperature $\theta$, eastward-moving $u$ and northward-moving $v$ wind speed. $\overline {w'c'}$ is the vertical turbulent flux of $c$, and $\frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial x}$ represents the horizontal turbulent flux of $c$.



Entrainment, on the other hand, is the process by which turbulent eddies at the edge of the boundary layer incorporate non-turbulent fluid from the surrounding environment into the turbulent flow. This process is crucial in the growth and evolution of the boundary layer, as it allows for the exchange of momentum, heat, and mass between the boundary layer and the surrounding fluid.



The entrainment rate, $E$, can be defined as:



$$

E = \frac {d\delta}{dt}

$$



where $\delta$ is the boundary layer thickness and $t$ is time. This equation represents the rate of increase of the boundary layer thickness due to entrainment.



Both mixing and entrainment processes are influenced by several factors, including the stability of the stratification, the intensity of the turbulence, and the presence of rotation. Understanding these processes and their interactions is crucial for accurate modeling and prediction of the behavior of the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers.



#### Subsection: 4.4d Boundary Layer Observations and Modeling



Observations and modeling of turbulent boundary layers are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. The use of remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery, has been instrumental in observing and understanding phenomena like mesoscale cellular convection (MCC).



As mentioned in the previous context, MCC is a form of buoyantly driven convection that provides the planetary boundary layer with cumulus clouds at the top of the boundary layer. This phenomenon is primarily observed over ocean regions and is particularly prevalent off the coasts of major continents. MCC is characterized by the formation of hexagonal cloud structures, a form of the Bénard cell, where the fluid rises or falls in hexagonal cells.



Satellite observations have been crucial in understanding the horizontal and vertical scales of these cloud formations. For instance, satellite images from TIROS have highlighted significant differences between laboratory convection cells and those that occur in the atmosphere. The ratio of the diameter of the hexagon compared to the depth of the cloud was found to be much larger in the atmosphere, indicating that eddy diffusion of heat and momentum dominates the atmospheric cells, while viscosity and heat conduction are more important in laboratory measurements.



Modeling of turbulent boundary layers, on the other hand, involves the use of mathematical equations to represent the various processes occurring within the boundary layer. For instance, the mixing process can be represented by the equation:



$$

\frac {\partial \bar {c}}{\partial t}=-\frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial z} + \frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial x}

$$



where $\bar {c}$ is the mean of quantity $c$, which could be water vapor mixing ratio $q$, potential temperature $\theta$, eastward-moving $u$ and northward-moving $v$ wind speed. $\overline {w'c'}$ is the vertical turbulent flux of $c$, and $\frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial x}$ represents the horizontal turbulent flux of $c$.



The entrainment rate, $E$, which represents the rate of increase of the boundary layer thickness due to entrainment, can be defined as:



$$

E = \frac {d\delta}{dt}

$$



where $\delta$ is the boundary layer thickness and $t$ is time.



These equations, along with observations from remote sensing technologies, provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of turbulent boundary layers in the ocean and atmosphere.

## Chapter: Nonlinear Internal Waves



### Introduction



The ocean and atmosphere are two of the most dynamic systems on Earth, with a myriad of processes occurring simultaneously. One such process, the formation and propagation of internal waves, is a topic of great interest and complexity. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of nonlinear internal waves, a phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the transport of energy and momentum in both the ocean and the atmosphere.



Nonlinear internal waves are a type of internal wave where the amplitude is so large that the wave behavior deviates from the linear wave theory. These waves are characterized by their ability to maintain their shape over long distances and periods of time, unlike linear waves which tend to dissipate more quickly. Nonlinear internal waves are not only fascinating from a theoretical perspective, but they also have significant practical implications. They can influence the distribution of nutrients in the ocean, affect the stability of offshore structures, and even impact climate models.



In this chapter, we will explore the physics behind nonlinear internal waves, including the conditions necessary for their formation and the mathematical models used to describe their behavior. We will also discuss the methods used to observe and measure these waves in the ocean and atmosphere, and the challenges associated with these observations. 



Understanding nonlinear internal waves is not just an academic exercise. It is a crucial component in our broader understanding of how the ocean and atmosphere function, and how they might respond to changes in our planet's climate. As we delve into the complexities of these waves, we will gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate and interconnected nature of the world's oceanic and atmospheric systems. 



Join us as we embark on this journey into the world of nonlinear internal waves, a journey that will take us from the depths of the ocean to the heights of the atmosphere, and deepen our understanding of these vital systems.



### Section: 5.1 Solitary Waves



Solitary waves, also known as solitons, are a unique type of nonlinear wave that maintain their shape while propagating at a constant velocity. These waves are a fascinating subject of study due to their unique properties and their presence in both the ocean and the atmosphere.



#### Subsection 5.1a Generation and Propagation of Solitary Waves



Solitary waves are generated when a disturbance in the medium causes a shift from equilibrium, and the medium's inherent properties cause it to restore balance in a nonlinear manner. This results in the formation of a solitary wave, a single hump of water or air that travels with a constant velocity. 



The velocity of a solitary wave is determined by the total water depth under the wave crest, with higher waves traveling faster than lower waves. This is a result of the nonlinear gravity wave effect. The single soliton solution of the Korteweg–de Vries equation, which describes the wave height "H" in water depth "h" far away from the wave crest, travels with the velocity:



$$

c = \sqrt{g(h + H)}

$$



where "g" is the acceleration due to gravity. Note that solitary wave solutions only exist for positive values of "H", solitary gravity waves of depression do not exist.



In deep water, the linear dispersion relation – unaffected by wave amplitude – is also correct for nonlinear waves at the second order of the perturbation theory expansion. To the third order, and for deep water, the dispersion relation is:



$$

\omega = \sqrt{gk \tanh(kh)}

$$



This implies that large waves travel faster than small ones of the same frequency. This is only noticeable when the wave steepness $ka$ (where "a" is wave amplitude) is large.



When solitary waves are on a mean current, they experience a Doppler shift. The dispersion relation for a non-moving medium is:



$$

\omega = \sqrt{gk \tanh(kh)}

$$



Then for a medium with mean velocity vector V, the dispersion relationship with Doppler shift becomes:



$$

\omega - k \cdot V = \sqrt{gk \tanh(kh)}

$$



where k is the wavenumber vector, related to "k" as: $k = |k|$. The dot product $k \cdot V$ is equal to: $k \cdot V = kV \cos \alpha$, with "V" the length of the mean velocity vector V: $V = |V|$. And "$\alpha$" the angle between the wave propagation direction and the mean flow direction.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models used to describe the behavior of solitary waves and the methods used to observe and measure these waves in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### Subsection 5.1b Internal Wave Breaking and Turbulence



Breaking internal waves play a significant role in the mixing of the ocean. This phenomenon is extensively studied through lab experiments, remote sensing, and direct numerical simulations. Despite the extensive research, there remains a degree of uncertainty in global estimates of the impact of internal wave breaking on local turbulence.



When internal tidal waves break, they can create turbulent water columns that reach several hundred meters in height. The turbulent kinetic energy in these columns can reach levels up to 10,000 times higher than in the open ocean. 



The intensity of the turbulence caused by breaking internal waves is primarily dependent on the internal Iribarren number, which is the ratio between topographical steepness and wave steepness. A smaller internal Iribarren number correlates with a larger intensity of the resulting turbulence due to internal wave breaking. This implies that a smaller internal Iribarren number predicts a higher transfer of wave energy to mixing and turbulence, while a larger internal Iribarren number predicts that the wave energy will reflect offshore.



The mixing efficiency, denoted by $\gamma$, is defined as the ratio between the total amount of mixing and the total irreversible energy loss. It can be mathematically represented as:



$$

\gamma = \frac{\Delta V}{E}

$$



where $\Delta V$ is the change in background potential energy due to mixing and $E$ is the total energy expended. However, since $\Delta V$ and $E$ are not directly observable, different definitions are used in various studies to determine the mixing efficiency.



Estimating the mixing efficiency in the ocean is a challenging task due to practical limitations in measuring ocean dynamics. Apart from measurements of ocean dynamics, the mixing efficiency can also be obtained from laboratory experiments. However, these experiments also come with their own set of challenges and limitations. 



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mechanisms of internal wave breaking and the resulting turbulence, as well as the methods used to estimate mixing efficiency. We will also discuss the implications of these phenomena on the larger scale oceanic and atmospheric dynamics.



#### Subsection 5.1c Solitary Wave Interactions and Wave-Wave Interactions



Solitary waves, as discussed in the context of shallow water, are near-solitons that travel with a constant velocity. However, when two solitary waves interact, either by colliding or overtaking each other, they undergo changes in amplitude and leave behind an oscillatory residual. This phenomenon is a result of the nonlinear nature of these waves.



The interaction of solitary waves can be described mathematically by the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation. The KdV equation is a third-order partial differential equation that describes the propagation of waves in shallow water. It is given by:



$$

\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + 6u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial x^3} = 0

$$



where $u$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate. The KdV equation is derived from the conservation of mass and momentum, assuming a weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive wave.



The interaction of two solitary waves can be visualized as a collision process. When two solitary waves of different amplitudes approach each other, the larger wave overtakes the smaller one. After the interaction, the waves re-emerge with the same shape and speed as before the interaction, but with a phase shift. This behavior is a characteristic feature of solitons and is known as the soliton principle.



Wave-wave interactions, on the other hand, are a fundamental aspect of ocean and atmospheric dynamics. These interactions can lead to the transfer of energy between waves of different scales, contributing to the overall energy balance in the ocean and atmosphere. For instance, the interaction between large-scale ocean waves and smaller-scale internal waves can lead to the generation of turbulence, as discussed in the previous section.



In the context of deep water, the dispersion relation indicates that larger waves travel faster than smaller ones of the same frequency. This effect, known as dispersion, can lead to the breaking of waves and the generation of turbulence. The Doppler shift also plays a role in wave-wave interactions, as it affects the frequency of waves moving in a medium with a mean velocity.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical modeling of wave-wave interactions and their implications for ocean and atmospheric dynamics.



#### 5.1d Applications of Solitary Waves in Oceanography



Solitary waves, due to their unique properties, have significant applications in the field of oceanography. They play a crucial role in the transport of energy and momentum across the ocean, influencing a wide range of oceanic phenomena.



One of the key applications of solitary waves is in the study of tsunamis. Tsunamis are essentially a series of solitary waves, generated by disturbances such as earthquakes or landslides. The Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation, which describes the propagation of solitary waves in shallow water, is often used to model tsunamis. The ability of solitary waves to maintain their shape and speed over long distances makes them an ideal model for tsunamis, which can travel across entire ocean basins with little energy loss.



Solitary waves also play a significant role in the generation of internal waves in the ocean. These waves occur at the interface between layers of water with different densities, and can transport energy and momentum vertically through the water column. The interaction between solitary waves and internal waves can lead to the generation of turbulence, contributing to the mixing of ocean waters and the distribution of heat and nutrients.



Furthermore, the Doppler shift of water waves on a mean flow is another important aspect in oceanography. The Doppler shift, which is the change in frequency and wavelength of a wave as observed by someone moving relative to the wave source, can significantly affect the propagation of solitary waves. For instance, a current flowing in the same direction as a solitary wave can increase its speed and decrease its wavelength, while a current flowing in the opposite direction can have the opposite effect.



In conclusion, solitary waves, with their unique properties and behaviors, provide valuable insights into various oceanic phenomena. Their study not only enhances our understanding of the ocean's dynamics but also aids in predicting and mitigating the impacts of natural disasters like tsunamis.



#### 5.2a Generation and Propagation of Topographic Waves



Topographic waves, also known as topographic Rossby waves, are a type of internal wave that is generated and influenced by the topography of the ocean floor or the atmospheric landscape. These waves are of particular interest due to their unique properties and their significant role in the transport of energy and momentum in both the ocean and the atmosphere.



The generation of topographic waves is primarily influenced by the interaction between the fluid flow and the underlying topography. When a steady, geostrophic flow encounters a change in the bottom slope, it can give rise to topographic waves. The dispersion relation for these waves is given by:



$$

\omega = {\alpha_0 g \over f_0}{k_x \over 1+R^2(k_x^2+k_y^2)}

$$



where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave, $\alpha_0$ is the bottom slope, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter, $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the wavenumbers in the x- and y- direction respectively, and $R$ is the Rossby radius of deformation. 



If there is no bottom slope ($\alpha_{0}=0$), the expression above yields no waves, but a steady and geostrophic flow. This is the reason why these waves are called topographic Rossby waves.



The propagation of topographic waves is governed by the phase speed of the waves along the isobaths (lines of equal depth). The phase speed is determined by the balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force, and it is influenced by the bottom slope and the stratification of the fluid. 



The maximum frequency of the topographic Rossby waves is given by:



$$

\left\vert \omega \right\vert _{max} ={ \left\vert \alpha_0 \right\vert g \over 2\left\vert f_0 \right\vert R }

$$



which is attained for $k_x = R^{-1}$ and $k_y = 0$. If the forcing creates waves with frequencies above this threshold, no Rossby waves are generated. This situation rarely happens, unless $\alpha_0$ is very small. In all other cases $\left\vert \omega \right\vert_{max}$ exceeds $\left\vert f_0 \right\vert$ and the theory breaks down. 



In conclusion, topographic waves, with their unique properties and behaviors, provide valuable insights into various oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Their study not only enhances our understanding of the dynamics of the ocean and the atmosphere but also aids in predicting and mitigating the impacts of natural disasters such as tsunamis and storms.



#### 5.2b Internal Tides and Wave-Tide Interactions



Internal tides are a type of internal wave that is generated by the interaction of the surface tide with the ocean floor topography. They are a significant component of the ocean's energy budget and play a crucial role in the vertical mixing of the ocean's waters.



The generation of internal tides is primarily influenced by the interaction between the tidal flow and the underlying topography. When the barotropic (surface) tide encounters a change in the bottom slope, it can give rise to internal tides. The energy of the surface tide is transferred to the internal tide, leading to a decrease in the surface tide's amplitude and an increase in the internal tide's amplitude.



The dispersion relation for internal tides is given by:



$$

\omega^2 = N^2 \left( \frac{k_h^2}{k^2} \right)

$$



where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the tide, $N$ is the buoyancy frequency, $k_h$ is the horizontal wavenumber, and $k$ is the total wavenumber. The buoyancy frequency $N$ is a measure of the stratification of the fluid and is defined as:



$$

N^2 = -g \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z} \frac{1}{\rho}

$$



where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate.



The propagation of internal tides is governed by the group velocity of the waves, which is determined by the balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force, and it is influenced by the bottom slope and the stratification of the fluid. 



The interaction between internal tides and topographic waves can lead to the generation of secondary waves and the transfer of energy between different wave modes. This interaction is a complex process that is still not fully understood and is the subject of ongoing research.



The amplitude and cycle time of internal tides are influenced by a variety of factors, including the amplitude and phase of the surface tide, the shape and slope of the ocean floor, and the stratification of the ocean's waters. The theoretical amplitude of internal tides can reach up to 200 meters in the open ocean, but real amplitudes are typically much smaller due to energy losses from friction and wave breaking. The cycle time of internal tides is typically 12 hours, corresponding to the semi-diurnal tide, but can also be 24 hours for diurnal tides.



#### 5.2c Wave-Topography Interactions and Energy Dissipation



The interaction between waves and topography is a fundamental aspect of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence. This interaction can lead to the generation of topographic waves, which are waves that are influenced by the underlying topography. These waves play a crucial role in the energy budget of the ocean and atmosphere, and their study is essential for understanding the dynamics of these systems.



Topographic waves are generated when a flow encounters a change in the underlying topography. This can occur in both the ocean and the atmosphere, and the resulting waves can have a significant impact on the flow dynamics. The energy of the incoming flow is transferred to the topographic wave, leading to a decrease in the flow's energy and an increase in the wave's energy.



The energy dissipation in wave-topography interactions is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. These include the amplitude and frequency of the incoming wave, the shape and slope of the topography, and the stratification of the fluid. The energy dissipation can be described by the following equation:



$$

E_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2 \omega \alpha

$$



where $E_d$ is the energy dissipation, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave, and $\alpha$ is the dissipation coefficient.



The dissipation coefficient $\alpha$ is a measure of the efficiency of the energy transfer from the wave to the topography. It is influenced by the shape and slope of the topography, and it can vary significantly depending on the specific characteristics of the interaction.



The study of wave-topography interactions and energy dissipation is a complex and challenging field. It requires a deep understanding of the physics of waves and turbulence, as well as advanced mathematical and computational tools. Despite the challenges, it is a crucial area of research for understanding the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, and for predicting their future behavior in a changing climate.



#### 5.2d Impacts of Topographic Waves on Coastal Processes



Topographic waves, as we have discussed, are significantly influenced by the underlying topography and play a crucial role in the energy budget of the ocean and atmosphere. In this section, we will delve into the impacts of these waves on coastal processes.



Coastal processes are largely influenced by the energy transferred from the ocean to the coast through waves. Topographic waves, in particular, can have a profound impact on these processes due to their interaction with the coastal topography. This interaction can lead to a variety of phenomena, including wave refraction, diffraction, reflection, and breaking, all of which can significantly alter the wave energy distribution along the coast.



The impact of topographic waves on coastal processes can be studied using scientific software such as ARTEMIS and TOMAWAC, which are part of the TELEMAC-MASCARET system. These tools simulate wave propagation towards the coast and calculate the main wave characteristics over the computational domain, including significant wave height, wave incidence, orbital velocities, and breaking rate.



ARTEMIS, for instance, solves the Berkhoff's equation or Mild Slope Equation through finite element formulation, integrating dissipation processes. It has been validated on a set of reference tests and has been successfully used for numerous studies, showing its ability to provide reliable wave agitation results in coastal areas, in the vicinity of maritime works and structures, or in the surf zone.



On the other hand, TOMAWAC models wave propagation in coastal areas by solving a simplified equation for the spectro-angular density of wave action. It calculates the wave characteristics at each point of the computational mesh, and has been validated with a variety of test cases, making it ideal for engineering projects such as the design of maritime structures and sediment transport by waves.



The study of the impacts of topographic waves on coastal processes is crucial for understanding and predicting coastal dynamics. It can provide valuable insights for the design and planning of coastal infrastructure, the management of coastal resources, and the mitigation of coastal hazards. However, it is a complex field that requires a deep understanding of the physics of waves and turbulence, as well as advanced mathematical and computational tools. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits make it a worthwhile endeavor.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Turbulence in the Ocean



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is ubiquitous in the natural world. It is a key player in the ocean, influencing a wide range of processes from the mixing of heat and salt to the transport of nutrients and pollutants. This chapter, "Turbulence in the Ocean," aims to delve into the intricate world of oceanic turbulence, exploring its causes, characteristics, and consequences.



Oceanic turbulence is a fascinating subject, not only because of its inherent complexity but also due to its profound impact on the global climate system. The ocean, covering about 70% of the Earth's surface, plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate. Turbulence in the ocean contributes to the vertical mixing of heat, salt, and other properties, thereby affecting the ocean's stratification and circulation patterns. These, in turn, influence the global climate system.



Understanding oceanic turbulence is not a straightforward task. It involves a multitude of scales, from the tiny Kolmogorov microscales to the vast ocean basin scales. The turbulence is driven by various forces, including wind stress at the surface, tidal forces, and buoyancy forces due to temperature and salinity gradients. The interaction of these forces leads to a rich variety of turbulent flows, each with its unique characteristics and implications.



This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of oceanic turbulence. We will start by discussing the fundamental concepts and theories of turbulence, including the famous Kolmogorov's theory. We will then delve into the various sources of turbulence in the ocean, exploring how they interact to generate the observed turbulent flows. We will also discuss the methods used to measure and model oceanic turbulence, highlighting the challenges and recent advances in this field. Finally, we will examine the role of turbulence in the ocean's heat and salt transport, and its implications for the global climate system.



In this journey through the world of oceanic turbulence, we hope to provide a deeper understanding of this complex phenomenon and its far-reaching impacts. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply someone interested in the mysteries of the ocean, we believe this chapter will offer valuable insights and stimulate further exploration into this fascinating subject.



### Section: 6.1 Oceanic Turbulence:



Oceanic turbulence is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the ocean's dynamics and its interaction with the atmosphere. It is a key driver of the ocean's mixing processes, influencing the distribution of heat, salt, nutrients, and pollutants. Understanding the generation and characteristics of oceanic turbulence is therefore essential for a comprehensive understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system.



#### 6.1a Oceanic Turbulence Generation



The generation of oceanic turbulence is a result of the interaction of various forces and processes. These include wind stress at the ocean surface, tidal forces, and buoyancy forces due to temperature and salinity gradients. 



Wind stress at the ocean surface is a primary source of turbulence. The friction between the wind and the ocean surface generates turbulent eddies, which can penetrate to significant depths depending on the wind's strength and duration. This process is particularly important in the upper ocean, where it contributes to the vertical mixing of heat and momentum.



Tidal forces also play a crucial role in generating turbulence. The gravitational pull of the moon and the sun causes the ocean's tides, which can generate turbulence through the interaction with the ocean's bottom topography and the Coriolis effect. This tidal mixing is particularly significant in shallow coastal areas and around seamounts and ridges.



Buoyancy forces due to temperature and salinity gradients are another important source of turbulence. Differences in temperature and salinity create density gradients in the ocean, leading to buoyancy-driven flows. When these flows become unstable, they can generate turbulence. This process, known as convective instability, is a key driver of turbulence in the ocean's interior.



In addition to these primary sources, other processes such as internal waves, shear instabilities, and the breaking of surface waves can also generate turbulence. The interaction of these various sources leads to a rich variety of turbulent flows, each with its unique characteristics and implications.



Understanding the generation of oceanic turbulence is a complex task due to the multitude of scales involved, from the tiny Kolmogorov microscales to the vast ocean basin scales. It requires a combination of observational data, theoretical models, and numerical simulations. Despite the challenges, significant progress has been made in recent years, enhancing our understanding of this fascinating and important phenomenon.



#### 6.1b Oceanic Turbulence Dissipation



The dissipation of oceanic turbulence is a critical process that contributes to the overall energy balance of the ocean. It is the mechanism by which the kinetic energy of turbulent motions is converted into heat, thereby increasing the ocean's internal energy and contributing to the ocean's heat budget.



The primary mechanism for the dissipation of turbulence in the ocean is through the action of molecular viscosity. As turbulent eddies cascade from larger to smaller scales, they eventually reach a scale at which molecular viscosity becomes significant. At these scales, the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is converted into heat through viscous dissipation. This process is often referred to as the "energy cascade" in turbulence.



The rate of energy dissipation due to turbulence, often denoted by $\epsilon$, is a key parameter in the study of oceanic turbulence. It is typically estimated from measurements of turbulent velocity and temperature fluctuations, using the relation:



$$

\epsilon = \nu \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \right)^2

$$



where $\nu$ is the molecular viscosity, $u$ is the velocity, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate. This equation is derived from the viscous dissipation term in the energy equation for turbulent flows.



The dissipation of turbulence also plays a crucial role in the subgridscale parameterization schemes used in ocean general circulation models. These schemes aim to represent the effects of unresolved turbulent motions on the resolved scales of motion. The dissipation of turbulence is one of the key processes that need to be parameterized in these schemes, as it affects the energy balance and mixing processes in the model.



In addition to molecular viscosity, other processes can also contribute to the dissipation of turbulence in the ocean. These include wave breaking, stratification, and interactions with the ocean bottom topography. However, these processes are often more difficult to quantify and are typically represented through empirical parameterizations in ocean models.



In conclusion, the dissipation of oceanic turbulence is a complex process that plays a crucial role in the ocean's dynamics and energy balance. Understanding this process is essential for accurately modeling the ocean's circulation and its role in the Earth's climate system.



#### 6.1c Oceanic Turbulence Modeling



Oceanic turbulence modeling is a crucial aspect of understanding and predicting the behavior of the ocean. It involves the use of mathematical models to represent the complex, chaotic motions of the ocean's waters. These models are essential tools in the study of oceanic turbulence, as they allow us to simulate and analyze turbulent flows that would be otherwise impossible to study directly.



One of the key challenges in oceanic turbulence modeling is the so-called "closure problem". This problem arises from the fact that the equations of motion for turbulent flows, known as the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, contain more unknowns than equations. This is due to the fact that turbulence involves a wide range of scales of motion, from large-scale currents down to small-scale eddies, and the RANS equations cannot fully capture this multiscale nature.



To overcome the closure problem, oceanic turbulence models often employ subgridscale (SGS) parameterization schemes. These schemes aim to represent the effects of the unresolved, small-scale turbulent motions on the resolved, large-scale motions. The SGS parameterization schemes are based on various assumptions and approximations, and they are a subject of ongoing research and development.



The SGS parameterization schemes can be broadly classified into two categories: lateral and vertical. The lateral schemes aim to represent the effects of horizontal turbulent motions, while the vertical schemes focus on the vertical motions. These schemes often employ filters and higher-order operators to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary.



In addition to the general SGS parameterization schemes, there are also special dynamical parameterizations for certain processes, such as topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion, and convection. These special parameterizations are designed to account for the specific effects of these processes on the turbulent flows.



The surface mixed layer (SML) is a particularly important region in the ocean, as it plays a crucial role in air-sea exchange. Therefore, the SML has historically received special attention in the development of SGS parameterization schemes. There are now many different schemes available for representing the effects of turbulence in the SML.



The development and validation of oceanic turbulence models is a complex task that requires a combination of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and observational data. Despite the challenges, these models are essential tools in the study of oceanic turbulence, and they play a crucial role in our ability to understand and predict the behavior of the ocean.



#### 6.1d Oceanic Turbulence Observations



Observations of oceanic turbulence are critical for validating and refining the mathematical models and parameterization schemes discussed in the previous section. These observations can be obtained through a variety of methods, including in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and the use of ocean general circulation models.



In-situ measurements of oceanic turbulence are often obtained through the deployment of oceanographic instruments such as current meters, thermistors, and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors. These instruments can provide valuable data on the velocity, temperature, and salinity of the ocean, which are key parameters in the study of oceanic turbulence. However, in-situ measurements are typically limited in spatial and temporal coverage due to logistical and financial constraints.



Remote sensing techniques, such as satellite altimetry and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), offer a way to obtain large-scale, continuous observations of the ocean surface. These techniques can provide information on sea surface height, wave height, and surface roughness, which can be used to infer the presence and intensity of turbulence. However, remote sensing techniques can only observe the surface layer of the ocean, and they are subject to various sources of error and uncertainty.



Ocean general circulation models (OGCMs), such as those used in the RAPID program, are powerful tools for studying oceanic turbulence. These models simulate the large-scale circulation of the ocean, taking into account the effects of wind stress, heat flux, and freshwater flux, as well as the influence of the Earth's rotation and topography. By incorporating subgridscale parameterization schemes, OGCMs can also represent the effects of small-scale turbulent motions on the large-scale circulation. However, the accuracy of OGCMs is dependent on the quality of the input data and the validity of the underlying assumptions and parameterizations.



Despite these challenges, observations of oceanic turbulence have led to significant advances in our understanding of the ocean. They have revealed the complex, multiscale nature of oceanic turbulence, and they have provided valuable insights into the role of turbulence in the transport of heat, salt, and momentum in the ocean. These observations have also highlighted the need for continued research and development in the field of oceanic turbulence modeling and parameterization.



### Section: 6.2 Oceanic Eddies:



Oceanic eddies are a significant component of oceanic turbulence. These are large rotating structures that are formed by the instability of ocean currents. They play a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, nutrients, and other properties across the ocean. 



#### 6.2a Oceanic Eddy Generation



The generation of oceanic eddies is primarily driven by the instability of large-scale ocean currents. This instability can be caused by a variety of factors, including changes in wind stress, temperature gradients, and the rotation of the Earth. 



One of the main mechanisms for eddy generation is baroclinic instability. This occurs when there is a vertical gradient in temperature and salinity, leading to a density gradient. The density gradient can destabilize the flow, causing it to meander and eventually break down into eddies. This process is particularly prevalent in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), where strong wind stress and temperature gradients are present.



Another important mechanism for eddy generation is barotropic instability. This occurs when there is a horizontal gradient in velocity, such as in the Gulf Stream. The velocity gradient can cause the flow to become unstable and form eddies. 



Eddies can also be generated by topographic features such as seamounts and continental slopes. These features can deflect the flow and cause it to become unstable, leading to the formation of eddies.



#### 6.2b Eddy Saturation and Eddy Compensation



Eddy saturation and eddy compensation are two important concepts in the study of oceanic eddies. Eddy saturation refers to the insensitivity of the mean current to the accelerating wind forcing, while eddy compensation refers to the near independence of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) to the increase of wind stress.



In the ACC, it is currently assumed that the current is fully eddy saturated, but only partially eddy compensated. This means that the transport in the ACC is insensitive to changes in wind stress, but the MOC is not completely independent of wind stress. The degree to which there is eddy compensation in the Southern Ocean is currently unknown.



#### 6.2c Models and Sensitivity



Eddy permitting and eddy resolving models are used to examine the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC. These models are of great importance in understanding the dynamics of oceanic eddies. However, the resolution of these models is a critical factor, as ocean observations do not have a high enough resolution to fully estimate the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation.



In these models, it has been found that the MOC response is more sensitive to model resolution than the ACC transport. This suggests that the dynamics of the MOC are more complex and require a higher resolution to accurately capture. Furthermore, these models have shown that southward eddy transport in combination with enhanced westerlies results in an increase in eddy kinetic energy.



is insensitive to changes in wind stress, but the MOC is not completely independent of these changes. 



#### 6.2c Oceanic Eddy Dynamics



Understanding the dynamics of oceanic eddies is crucial for predicting their behavior and their impact on the larger oceanic and atmospheric systems. The dynamics of oceanic eddies are governed by a complex interplay of forces, including the Coriolis effect, pressure gradients, and frictional forces.



The Coriolis effect, caused by the rotation of the Earth, imparts a rotational motion to the eddies. In the Northern Hemisphere, this causes the eddies to rotate in a clockwise direction, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate counterclockwise. This rotation is a key factor in determining the direction of heat and nutrient transport by the eddies.



Pressure gradients, caused by differences in water density, also play a crucial role in eddy dynamics. These gradients can drive the flow of water within the eddy, leading to the formation of a circular current. The strength and direction of this current can influence the transport of heat and nutrients by the eddy.



Frictional forces, caused by the interaction of the eddy with the surrounding water and the ocean floor, can also influence eddy dynamics. These forces can cause the eddy to lose energy and eventually dissipate. The rate of dissipation can depend on a variety of factors, including the size of the eddy, the depth of the water, and the roughness of the ocean floor.



Eddy dynamics can also be influenced by external factors such as wind stress and topography. For example, wind stress can impart energy to the eddy, causing it to grow in size and strength. Similarly, topographic features such as seamounts and continental slopes can deflect the flow of water, leading to the formation of eddies.



In conclusion, the dynamics of oceanic eddies are governed by a complex interplay of forces and factors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting the behavior of eddies and their impact on the larger oceanic and atmospheric systems.



#### 6.2c Oceanic Eddy Dissipation



The dissipation of oceanic eddies is a crucial aspect of their lifecycle and has significant implications for the transport of heat and nutrients in the ocean. The process of eddy dissipation involves the loss of energy from the eddy, which can occur through several mechanisms.



One of the primary mechanisms of eddy dissipation is through frictional forces. As an eddy moves through the water, it experiences resistance from the surrounding water and the ocean floor. This resistance, or drag, causes the eddy to lose energy and gradually dissipate. The rate of dissipation can depend on several factors, including the size of the eddy, the depth of the water, and the roughness of the ocean floor.



Another mechanism of eddy dissipation is through the process of wave radiation. As an eddy moves through the water, it can generate waves that radiate away from the eddy. These waves carry energy away from the eddy, leading to its dissipation. The rate of wave radiation can depend on the speed of the eddy, the stratification of the water, and the presence of other eddies or currents.



Eddy dissipation can also occur through the process of turbulent mixing. This involves the transfer of energy from the eddy to the surrounding water through turbulent fluctuations. The rate of turbulent mixing can depend on the intensity of the eddy, the stability of the water, and the presence of other eddies or currents.



The dissipation of oceanic eddies is a complex process that involves a delicate balance of forces. Understanding this process is crucial for predicting the behavior of eddies and their impact on the larger oceanic and atmospheric systems. Future research in this area could provide valuable insights into the role of eddies in the ocean's heat and nutrient transport, as well as their potential effects on climate change. 



In the context of eddy compensation, the dissipation of eddies can influence the balance between the Ekman transport and the eddy-induced transport. This can have implications for the sensitivity of the ACC and MOC to changes in wind stress. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of eddy dissipation in eddy compensation and its potential impacts on ocean circulation and climate.



#### 6.2d Oceanic Eddy Observations



Observing and measuring oceanic eddies is a challenging task due to their transient nature and the vastness of the ocean. However, advancements in technology and the development of sophisticated models have made it possible to gain valuable insights into the behavior of these eddies.



One of the primary methods of observing oceanic eddies is through satellite altimetry. This technique involves the use of radar signals from satellites to measure the sea surface height. Since eddies cause variations in the sea surface height, they can be detected and tracked using this method. Satellite altimetry has been instrumental in identifying and studying large-scale eddies in the ocean.



In addition to satellite altimetry, in-situ measurements are also used to observe oceanic eddies. These measurements are typically obtained using instruments such as Argo floats, which are autonomous devices that drift with the ocean currents and measure temperature and salinity at different depths. These data can be used to infer the presence of eddies and study their characteristics.



Numerical models also play a crucial role in the study of oceanic eddies. Eddy permitting and eddy resolving models, as mentioned in the context, are used to examine the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC. These models can simulate the formation, evolution, and dissipation of eddies, providing valuable insights into their dynamics.



However, it is important to note that the resolution of these models and observations is a critical factor in accurately capturing the behavior of eddies. Ocean observations do not have a high enough resolution to fully estimate the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation. Therefore, there is a need for more high-resolution observations and models to improve our understanding of oceanic eddies.



In the context of eddy compensation, observations of oceanic eddies can provide valuable information about the balance between the Ekman transport and the eddy-induced transport. By studying the behavior of eddies, we can gain insights into the mechanisms of eddy compensation and their implications for the oceanic and atmospheric systems.



In conclusion, observing and understanding oceanic eddies is a complex task that requires the use of advanced technology and sophisticated models. Despite the challenges, these efforts are crucial for improving our understanding of the ocean's dynamics and its role in the global climate system. Future research in this area has the potential to provide valuable insights into the behavior of oceanic eddies and their impact on the larger oceanic and atmospheric systems.



### Section: 6.3 Oceanic Boundary Layers:



The oceanic boundary layer is a critical component of the ocean's structure, playing a significant role in the exchange of heat, momentum, and mass between the ocean and the atmosphere. This layer is characterized by turbulence, which is driven by various factors such as wind stress, buoyancy fluxes, and wave breaking.



#### 6.3a Oceanic Boundary Layer Structure



The oceanic boundary layer can be divided into three main layers: the surface mixed layer, the pycnocline (or thermocline), and the deep ocean. 



The surface mixed layer is the uppermost layer of the ocean, typically extending to a depth of about 100 to 200 meters. This layer is directly influenced by atmospheric conditions and is characterized by nearly uniform temperature and salinity. The turbulence in this layer is primarily driven by wind stress and heat fluxes, leading to vertical mixing of properties.



Below the surface mixed layer is the pycnocline, a region of rapid change in density with depth, primarily due to changes in temperature (thermocline) and salinity (halocline). The turbulence in this layer is weaker than in the surface mixed layer, but it plays a crucial role in the vertical exchange of heat and other properties between the surface and the deep ocean.



The deep ocean, which extends from the base of the pycnocline to the ocean floor, is characterized by relatively stable stratification and weak turbulence. However, in certain regions such as the Labrador Sea and the Greenland Sea, deep convection can occur, leading to intense turbulence and mixing in the deep ocean.



Understanding the structure and dynamics of the oceanic boundary layer is crucial for predicting the ocean's response to atmospheric forcing and its role in climate variability. For instance, the depth of the surface mixed layer can influence the ocean's heat content and its ability to absorb atmospheric CO$_2$. Similarly, the strength of turbulence in the pycnocline can affect the vertical redistribution of heat and nutrients in the ocean.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the dynamics of each of these layers and the factors that influence their turbulence characteristics.



#### 6.3b Oceanic Boundary Layer Dynamics



The dynamics of the oceanic boundary layer are complex and multifaceted, involving a range of physical processes and interactions. These dynamics are primarily driven by the balance between the forces of turbulence and the stabilizing effects of stratification.



Turbulence in the oceanic boundary layer is generated by several mechanisms. Wind stress at the ocean surface is a primary source, inducing shear and leading to turbulent mixing in the surface mixed layer. Wave breaking also contributes to turbulence generation, particularly in stormy conditions. Additionally, buoyancy fluxes due to heat and freshwater inputs can drive turbulence, with positive buoyancy fluxes leading to convective instability and mixing.



The effects of turbulence are counteracted by the stabilizing influence of stratification, which acts to suppress vertical mixing. Stratification in the ocean is primarily due to variations in temperature and salinity with depth, leading to density gradients that resist vertical motion. The balance between turbulence and stratification determines the structure and dynamics of the oceanic boundary layer.



In the surface mixed layer, turbulence typically dominates over stratification, leading to a well-mixed layer with nearly uniform properties. The depth of the surface mixed layer can vary significantly, depending on the balance between wind-driven mixing and buoyancy fluxes. For instance, strong winds can deepen the mixed layer, while positive buoyancy fluxes due to surface warming can lead to its shoaling.



Below the surface mixed layer, in the pycnocline, stratification becomes stronger and turbulence weaker. However, turbulence in the pycnocline is crucial for the vertical exchange of heat, salt, and other properties between the surface and the deep ocean. This exchange can have significant implications for the ocean's role in climate, as it affects the ocean's heat content and carbon storage capacity.



In the deep ocean, stratification is typically strong and turbulence weak, leading to a relatively stable environment. However, in certain regions and under specific conditions, deep convection can occur, leading to intense turbulence and mixing in the deep ocean. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting the ocean's response to changes in atmospheric forcing and its role in climate variability.



The dynamics of the oceanic boundary layer are also influenced by subgrid-scale processes, which need to be parameterized in ocean models. These processes include molecular friction and diffusion, which, while negligible at large scales, are essential at smaller scales. The parameterization of these processes is a challenging aspect of ocean modeling, requiring a careful balance between physical realism and computational efficiency. 



In conclusion, the dynamics of the oceanic boundary layer are complex and involve a range of physical processes and scales. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting the ocean's response to atmospheric forcing and its role in climate variability.

#### 6.3c Oceanic Boundary Layer Mixing



The mixing within the oceanic boundary layer is a critical process that influences the distribution of heat, salt, and other properties in the ocean. This mixing is primarily driven by turbulence, which can be generated by several mechanisms, including wind stress, wave breaking, and buoyancy fluxes.



The role of wind stress in generating turbulence and mixing in the oceanic boundary layer has been well established. Wind stress induces shear at the ocean surface, leading to the generation of turbulent eddies that mix the surface waters. This process is particularly effective in the surface mixed layer, where turbulence typically dominates over stratification, leading to a well-mixed layer with nearly uniform properties.



Wave breaking is another important mechanism for turbulence generation and mixing in the oceanic boundary layer. When waves break, they generate turbulence that can mix the surface waters and contribute to the deepening of the surface mixed layer. This process is particularly significant in stormy conditions, where wave breaking can be intense.



Buoyancy fluxes due to heat and freshwater inputs can also drive turbulence and mixing in the oceanic boundary layer. Positive buoyancy fluxes, such as those due to surface warming or freshwater inputs, can lead to convective instability and mixing. This process can be particularly significant in regions of deep convection, such as the Labrador Sea, where the weak density stratification allows for intense wintertime convection and mixing (Kanzow et al., 2007; Cunningham et al., 2007).



The mixing in the oceanic boundary layer can have significant implications for the ocean's role in climate. For instance, the vertical exchange of heat and salt between the surface and the deep ocean, driven by turbulence and mixing in the pycnocline, can affect the ocean's heat content and carbon storage capacity. This exchange can also influence the strength of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), which plays a crucial role in the global climate system (Johns et al., 2009).



In conclusion, the mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, driven by turbulence generated by wind stress, wave breaking, and buoyancy fluxes, plays a crucial role in the distribution of heat, salt, and other properties in the ocean, and in the ocean's role in the global climate system.

#### 6.3d Oceanic Boundary Layer Observations



Observations of the oceanic boundary layer are crucial for understanding the dynamics of turbulence and mixing in the ocean. These observations can be obtained through various methods, including in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and numerical modeling.



In-situ measurements provide direct observations of the oceanic boundary layer. For instance, the RAPID program has been monitoring the ocean circulation since 2004, providing valuable data on the oceanic boundary layer (Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory). These measurements can provide insights into the spatial and temporal variability of turbulence and mixing in the oceanic boundary layer.



Remote sensing techniques, such as satellite observations, can provide large-scale, continuous observations of the oceanic boundary layer. These observations can be used to infer the distribution of turbulence and mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, although they are typically less direct and more uncertain than in-situ measurements.



Numerical modeling can also provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the oceanic boundary layer. These models can simulate the processes that generate turbulence and mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, such as wind stress, wave breaking, and buoyancy fluxes. They can also simulate the effects of these processes on the distribution of heat, salt, and other properties in the ocean.



Observations of the oceanic boundary layer have revealed significant spatial and temporal variability in turbulence and mixing. For instance, deep convection is observed in the subpolar North Atlantic, the Weddell Sea in the southern hemisphere, and the northwestern Mediterranean (Holdsworth et al., 2015). These regions are characterized by weak density stratification, which allows for intense wintertime convection and mixing. The Labrador Sea, in particular, is one of the most extreme ocean convection sites in the world, with depths between 1000 and 2000 m observed each winter.



These observations highlight the importance of the oceanic boundary layer in the ocean's role in climate. The vertical exchange of heat and salt between the surface and the deep ocean, driven by turbulence and mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, can affect the ocean's heat content and carbon storage capacity. This exchange can also influence the strength of the Meridional Overturning Circulation, a key component of the global climate system.



### Section: 6.4 Oceanic Internal Waves:



Oceanic internal waves are a significant component of the ocean's turbulence. These waves occur within the ocean's interior, where they are driven by tidal forces, wind stress, and the interaction of ocean currents with the seafloor topography. They play a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients within the ocean, and they can significantly influence the ocean's response to atmospheric forcing.



#### 6.4a Oceanic Internal Wave Generation



The generation of oceanic internal waves is a complex process that involves several mechanisms. One of the primary mechanisms is the interaction of tidal currents with the seafloor topography. As tidal currents flow over irregularities in the seafloor, they can generate internal waves that propagate vertically into the ocean's interior. This process is particularly effective in generating internal waves in regions where the tidal currents are strong and the seafloor topography is complex, such as around seamounts and continental slopes.



Another important mechanism for the generation of oceanic internal waves is wind stress. When the wind blows over the ocean surface, it can generate surface waves that can interact with the ocean's stratification to generate internal waves. This process is most effective in regions where the wind is strong and the ocean's stratification is weak, such as in the upper ocean during periods of strong wind forcing.



The interaction of ocean currents with the seafloor topography can also generate internal waves. When an ocean current encounters a change in the seafloor topography, such as a ridge or a slope, it can generate internal waves that propagate away from the topography. This process is particularly effective in generating internal waves in regions where the ocean currents are strong and the seafloor topography is complex.



The generation of oceanic internal waves is also influenced by the ocean's stratification. The ocean is stratified in density, with denser water lying beneath less dense water. This stratification provides the restoring force that allows internal waves to propagate. When the stratification is strong, the speed of internal waves is high, and their wavelength is long. Conversely, when the stratification is weak, the speed of internal waves is low, and their wavelength is short.



The generation of oceanic internal waves is a crucial process in the ocean's turbulence. These waves can transport heat, salt, and nutrients vertically and horizontally within the ocean, and they can significantly influence the ocean's response to atmospheric forcing. Understanding the generation of oceanic internal waves is therefore essential for understanding the dynamics of turbulence in the ocean.



#### 6.4b Oceanic Internal Wave Propagation



The propagation of oceanic internal waves is a dynamic process that is influenced by a variety of factors. These waves travel through the ocean's interior, carrying energy and momentum from their source regions to distant locations. The propagation of these waves is primarily governed by the ocean's stratification and the Coriolis effect, which is due to the Earth's rotation.



The ocean's stratification, characterized by layers of water with different densities, plays a crucial role in the propagation of internal waves. The speed at which these waves travel, known as the phase speed, is determined by the buoyancy frequency, which is a measure of the stratification. The buoyancy frequency, $N$, is given by the formula:



$$

N = \sqrt{-\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{d\rho}{dz}}

$$



where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ is a reference density, $d\rho/dz$ is the vertical gradient of density, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards). The phase speed of an internal wave, $c$, is then given by:



$$

c = \frac{\omega}{k}

$$



where $\omega$ is the frequency of the wave and $k$ is the wavenumber. For a given frequency, the phase speed is inversely proportional to the wavenumber, which means that waves with longer wavelengths (smaller wavenumbers) travel faster than waves with shorter wavelengths (larger wavenumbers).



The Coriolis effect also plays a significant role in the propagation of oceanic internal waves. Due to the Earth's rotation, the motion of these waves is deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection, known as the Coriolis force, can cause the waves to propagate in a direction that is not parallel to the direction of the initial wave generation. The Coriolis parameter, $f$, is given by:



$$

f = 2\Omega \sin(\phi)

$$



where $\Omega$ is the Earth's rotation rate and $\phi$ is the latitude. The Coriolis effect becomes more pronounced as the latitude increases, which can lead to significant differences in the propagation of internal waves in different parts of the ocean.



In addition to these factors, the propagation of oceanic internal waves can also be influenced by the seafloor topography and the presence of ocean currents. When these waves encounter changes in the seafloor topography or strong ocean currents, they can be refracted, reflected, or even dissipated. These interactions can significantly alter the propagation paths of the waves and can lead to complex spatial patterns of wave energy distribution in the ocean's interior.



#### 6.4c Oceanic Internal Wave Breaking



The breaking of oceanic internal waves is a significant process that contributes to the mixing of the ocean's interior. This process is analogous to the breaking of surface waves, but it occurs beneath the ocean surface where the density stratification and the Coriolis effect play crucial roles.



When an internal wave propagates through the ocean, it can encounter regions where the stratification changes abruptly or where the wave's amplitude becomes so large that the wave overturns and breaks. This breaking process can lead to the formation of turbulent eddies, which enhance the mixing of heat, salt, and other properties within the ocean.



The breaking of an internal wave can be described by the wave's Richardson number, $Ri$, which is a dimensionless quantity that compares the wave's buoyancy frequency, $N$, to its vertical shear, $S$. The Richardson number is given by the formula:



$$

Ri = \frac{N^2}{S^2}

$$



where $S$ is the vertical shear of the wave, defined as the change in the wave's horizontal velocity with respect to depth. When the Richardson number falls below a critical value, typically around 0.25, the wave is unstable and can break.



The breaking of internal waves can also be influenced by the Coriolis effect. As discussed in the previous section, the Coriolis effect can deflect the motion of internal waves, causing them to propagate in a direction that is not parallel to the direction of the initial wave generation. This deflection can lead to the interaction of internal waves with the ocean's topography or with other waves, which can trigger wave breaking.



The breaking of internal waves is a key mechanism for the transfer of energy from the large scales of ocean circulation to the small scales of turbulence. This energy transfer is essential for maintaining the ocean's stratification and for driving the global overturning circulation, which plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system.



#### 6.4d Oceanic Internal Wave Observations



Observations of oceanic internal waves are crucial for understanding their generation, propagation, and breaking, as well as their role in oceanic turbulence and mixing. These observations can be made using a variety of techniques, including in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and numerical modeling.



In-situ measurements of internal waves can be made using a variety of instruments, such as Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) profilers, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs), and moored instruments. These instruments can measure properties such as temperature, salinity, and current velocity, which can be used to infer the presence of internal waves and their characteristics.



For example, the RAPID program, which has been monitoring the ocean circulation since 2004, has provided valuable data on the generation and propagation of internal waves in the North Atlantic. The weak density stratification of the Labrador Sea, observed each wintertime, is a prime location for the generation of internal waves due to its extreme ocean convection. The deep convection in the Labrador Sea is significantly affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with the oceanic heat loss from the Labrador Sea being higher during the positive phase of NAO, contributing to a deeper convection and potentially more intense internal waves.



Remote sensing techniques, such as satellite altimetry and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), can also be used to observe internal waves. These techniques can provide a large-scale view of internal wave fields and can detect features such as wave fronts and wave-induced surface roughness.



Numerical modeling is another important tool for studying internal waves. Models can simulate the generation, propagation, and breaking of internal waves, and can be used to investigate the effects of various factors, such as stratification, rotation, and topography, on these processes. Models can also be used to study the effects of internal waves on larger-scale ocean circulation and mixing.



In conclusion, observations of oceanic internal waves are crucial for understanding their role in oceanic turbulence and mixing. These observations, combined with theoretical and numerical studies, can provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of internal waves and their impact on the ocean and the Earth's climate system.

## Chapter 7: Turbulence in the Atmosphere



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is ubiquitous in both the ocean and the atmosphere. This chapter, Chapter 7, focuses on the turbulence in the atmosphere, a subject of great interest and importance in the fields of meteorology, climatology, and environmental science. 



Atmospheric turbulence is a key factor in the transport and dispersion of particles, heat, momentum, and gases, influencing weather patterns, climate dynamics, and air quality. It is also of critical importance to aviation safety, as it can cause severe aircraft disturbances. Despite its significance, atmospheric turbulence remains a challenging topic due to its inherent complexity and the difficulty of direct measurement.



In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental principles of atmospheric turbulence, exploring its causes, characteristics, and effects. We will discuss the mathematical models used to describe and predict turbulence, including the Navier-Stokes equations and the Reynolds decomposition. We will also examine the methods and technologies used to measure and study atmospheric turbulence, such as wind tunnels, lidar, and numerical simulations.



Through this comprehensive study, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of atmospheric turbulence, shedding light on its role in shaping our world and its implications for various fields. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in a related field, we hope this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your exploration of this fascinating and complex phenomenon. 



As we navigate through the turbulent winds of this chapter, remember that the journey through the chaotic and unpredictable world of turbulence is, much like the phenomenon itself, full of surprises and discoveries.



### Section: 7.1 Atmospheric Turbulence:



Atmospheric turbulence is a complex and chaotic phenomenon that plays a significant role in the transport and dispersion of particles, heat, momentum, and gases. It influences weather patterns, climate dynamics, and air quality, and is of critical importance to aviation safety. Despite its significance, atmospheric turbulence remains a challenging topic due to its inherent complexity and the difficulty of direct measurement.



#### 7.1a Atmospheric Turbulence Generation



The generation of atmospheric turbulence is a complex process that involves a variety of factors. One of the primary sources of atmospheric turbulence is the interaction between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. This interaction is influenced by the Earth's rotation, the uneven heating of the Earth's surface, and the presence of physical obstacles such as mountains and buildings.



In the context of turbulence generation, power spectra are needed for each of the $n^2$ points on the surface; this encapsulates information about the turbulence intensity for each point. Under IEC standards, only one power spectrum is used; that is, all $n^2$ points have the same turbulence intensity.



With the power spectra, the spectral matrix can be formed. This is an $n^2$-by-$n^2$ matrix. The main diagonal of the spectral matrix contains the previously defined spectra for all $n^2$ points on the surface. The off-main diagonal elements contain all the cross spectra between the points. The cross spectra are determined by a specific function.



Due to the symmetry of the coherence matrix, only $(n^4 + n^2)/2$ elements are independent. This property can be exploited to lighten memory requirements when writing a program to simulate the Sandia method.



The spectral matrix, $S(\omega_k)$, can be written as the matrix product of a matrix, $H(\omega_k)$, and its transpose. That is,



$$

S(\omega_k) = H(\omega_k)H(\omega_k)^T

$$



$H(\omega_k)$ is ultimately needed to obtain the complex Fourier coefficients of the Fourier transforms of the time series of the wind speeds at all the points on the surface. Note - if the Fourier transform of a time domain function, $x(t)$, is $X(\omega)$, then the resultant spectrum is $S(\omega) \propto X(\omega)X^*(\omega)$; for multiple time domain functions, the Fourier coefficients can be stored in a matrix, which then means that the above equation is applicable.



There are an infinite number of solutions to the above expression; consequently, the assumption that $H(\omega_k)$ is a lower triangular matrix is made such that only one solution exists. The solution can be found via a Cholesky decomposition.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models used to describe and predict turbulence, including the Navier-Stokes equations and the Reynolds decomposition. We will also examine the methods and technologies used to measure and study atmospheric turbulence, such as wind tunnels, lidar, and numerical simulations.



#### 7.1b Atmospheric Turbulence Dissipation



The dissipation of atmospheric turbulence is another complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. The dissipation of turbulence refers to the process by which turbulent kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. This process is primarily governed by the viscosity of the air, which acts to dampen the turbulent fluctuations.



The rate of turbulence dissipation, often denoted as $\epsilon$, is a key parameter in turbulence modeling. It is typically estimated from measurements of the turbulence kinetic energy and its rate of change. The dissipation rate can be expressed as:



$$

\epsilon = 2 \nu \sum_{i,j} S_{ij} S_{ij}

$$



where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $S_{ij}$ is the rate of strain tensor, which describes the rate at which fluid particles are deforming. The summation is over all spatial dimensions.



The dissipation of turbulence is not uniform throughout the atmosphere. It is influenced by factors such as the stability of the atmospheric stratification, the intensity of the turbulence, and the presence of physical obstacles. For example, turbulence dissipation rates are typically higher near the Earth's surface and decrease with altitude.



In the context of the Dryden and von Kármán models, the dissipation of turbulence is implicitly accounted for by the length scales and turbulence intensities. These parameters are adjusted to match the observed power spectral densities of turbulence, which reflect the balance between the generation and dissipation of turbulence.



In the next section, we will discuss the effects of atmospheric turbulence on aviation and how it can be mitigated.



#### 7.1c Atmospheric Turbulence Modeling



Atmospheric turbulence modeling is a critical aspect of meteorology and aviation. It involves the use of mathematical equations and numerical methods to simulate and predict the behavior of turbulence in the atmosphere. The goal of turbulence modeling is to provide accurate and reliable predictions of turbulence, which can be used to improve weather forecasts, enhance the safety and efficiency of aviation, and advance our understanding of atmospheric dynamics.



One of the fundamental equations used in atmospheric turbulence modeling is the Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the motion of fluid substances such as air. The Navier-Stokes equation is a set of partial differential equations derived from the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. However, due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the Navier-Stokes equation, it is challenging to solve it directly, especially for turbulent flows.



To overcome this challenge, turbulence models are developed to approximate the effects of turbulence. These models introduce additional equations to represent the turbulent stresses and fluxes, which are the main contributors to the mixing and transport of momentum, heat, and moisture in the atmosphere.



One of the most commonly used turbulence models is the K-epsilon ($k-\epsilon$) model. This model introduces two additional equations: one for the turbulence kinetic energy $k$, and another for the turbulence dissipation rate $\epsilon$. The $k-\epsilon$ model is widely used due to its robustness and simplicity, but it has limitations in representing the anisotropy of turbulence and the effects of atmospheric stability.



Another popular turbulence model is the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model. The LES model resolves the large-scale turbulent eddies directly and models the small-scale eddies. This approach provides a more accurate representation of the turbulence structure, but it requires more computational resources.



In addition to these models, there are many other turbulence models, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The choice of turbulence model depends on the specific application and the available computational resources.



In the context of atmospheric turbulence, the primitive equations are often used as the basis for turbulence modeling. The primitive equations are a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations that are suitable for large-scale atmospheric flows. These equations take into account the rotation of the Earth and the stratification of the atmosphere, which are important factors in atmospheric turbulence.



The modeling of atmospheric turbulence also involves the consideration of atmospheric water vapor. Water vapor is a key component of the atmosphere that affects the development and dissipation of turbulence. The presence of water vapor can enhance the buoyancy of air parcels and trigger convective turbulence. On the other hand, the condensation of water vapor can release latent heat and dampen turbulence. Therefore, the accurate representation of water vapor is crucial for the realistic modeling of atmospheric turbulence.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the specific turbulence models and their applications in atmospheric science and aviation.



#### 7.1d Atmospheric Turbulence Observations



Observing atmospheric turbulence is a crucial part of understanding its behavior and effects. These observations can be made using a variety of methods, including ground-based instruments, aircraft, and satellites. 



Ground-based instruments such as anemometers, wind profilers, and weather radars can provide valuable data on wind speed and direction, which are essential for studying turbulence. For instance, anemometers measure wind speed and direction at a specific location, while wind profilers and weather radars can provide vertical profiles of wind speed and direction, which can help identify regions of turbulence in the atmosphere.



Aircraft are also used to observe atmospheric turbulence. They can carry instruments that measure temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed and direction. These measurements can be used to identify regions of turbulence and study their characteristics. For example, the Epsilon Reticuli aircraft has been used to observe turbulence in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.



Satellites provide another means of observing atmospheric turbulence. They can measure the temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction over large areas, providing a global view of atmospheric conditions. Satellites can also observe cloud patterns, which can indicate regions of turbulence. For instance, the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope has filters that can be used to observe cloud patterns in the mid-infrared spectrum, which can help identify regions of turbulence.



Lightning observations can also provide information about atmospheric turbulence. For example, anvil crawler lightning, also known as spider lightning, often occurs in regions of intense turbulence in thunderstorms. Observations of this type of lightning can provide insights into the dynamics of thunderstorms and the associated turbulence.



In conclusion, observing atmospheric turbulence is a complex task that requires a variety of methods and instruments. These observations are essential for improving our understanding of turbulence and its effects on weather, climate, and aviation.



### Section: 7.2 Atmospheric Eddies:



Atmospheric eddies are a significant component of atmospheric turbulence. They are essentially swirling air masses that can range in size from small-scale turbulence to large-scale weather systems. These eddies play a crucial role in the transport of momentum, heat, and moisture in the atmosphere.



#### 7.2a Atmospheric Eddy Generation



Atmospheric eddies are generated by a variety of mechanisms. One of the primary sources of eddy generation is the instability in the atmospheric flow. This instability can arise due to differences in temperature, pressure, or wind speed and direction. For instance, when warm air rises and cool air descends, it can create a rolling motion that forms an eddy. Similarly, when wind encounters a physical obstacle, such as a mountain or a building, it can cause the wind to swirl and form an eddy.



Another significant source of eddy generation is the interaction between different air masses. When two air masses with different temperatures and pressures meet, it can lead to the formation of eddies. This is often seen at the boundary of cold fronts and warm fronts, where the interaction between the cold and warm air can lead to the formation of large-scale eddies, often associated with storm systems.



Eddies can also be generated by wind shear, which is a difference in wind speed or direction over a short distance. Wind shear can cause the air to rotate and form an eddy. This is often seen in the upper atmosphere, where the wind speed and direction can change rapidly with altitude.



The generation of eddies is a complex process that involves a combination of these and other factors. Understanding the mechanisms of eddy generation is crucial for predicting and modeling atmospheric turbulence and weather patterns.



In the next section, we will discuss the role of eddies in the transport of heat, moisture, and momentum in the atmosphere.



#### 7.2b Atmospheric Eddy Dynamics



The dynamics of atmospheric eddies are governed by the fundamental laws of fluid dynamics, which are expressed in the form of the primitive equations. These equations describe the motion of fluid in the atmosphere, taking into account the effects of rotation and stratification. 



The quasi-geostrophic approximation is often used to simplify these equations for large-scale atmospheric motions. This approximation assumes that the horizontal scales of motion are much larger than the vertical scales, and that the flow is nearly geostrophic. In this approximation, the horizontal velocity is decomposed into geostrophic and ageostrophic components, denoted as $\bar{u}$, $\bar{v}$ and $\tilde{u}$, $\tilde{v}$ respectively.



The geostrophic components represent the balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force, while the ageostrophic components represent deviations from this balance. The ageostrophic components are typically much smaller than the geostrophic components, and they play a crucial role in the dynamics of atmospheric eddies.



The equations governing the ageostrophic components are:



$$

\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]

\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]

{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.

$$



These equations describe the evolution of the ageostrophic components in response to changes in the atmospheric pressure field $\eta$. They show that the ageostrophic components are driven by the second derivatives of the pressure field with respect to time and space, and they are damped by the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force.



These dynamics are crucial for the formation and evolution of atmospheric eddies. The ageostrophic components represent the swirling motion of the eddies, and their evolution is driven by the instabilities in the atmospheric flow. These instabilities can arise from differences in temperature, pressure, or wind speed and direction, as well as from the interaction between different air masses.



In the next section, we will discuss the role of atmospheric eddies in the transport of heat, moisture, and momentum in the atmosphere.



#### 7.2c Atmospheric Eddy Dissipation



The dissipation of atmospheric eddies is a critical process in the atmospheric dynamics. It is through this process that the energy and momentum contained in the eddies are transferred back to the mean flow or dissipated as heat. This process is governed by the laws of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, and it is influenced by various factors such as the stratification of the atmosphere, the rotation of the Earth, and the interaction with the underlying surface.



The dissipation of eddies can be described by the following equation:



$$

\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot (\vec{u} E) - \nabla \cdot (\vec{u}' E') - \frac{\partial (u'w')}{\partial z} - \epsilon

$$



where $E$ is the eddy kinetic energy, $\vec{u}$ is the mean wind vector, $\vec{u}'$ is the eddy wind vector, $w'$ is the vertical velocity perturbation, and $\epsilon$ is the dissipation rate of the eddy kinetic energy.



The first term on the right-hand side represents the advection of eddy kinetic energy by the mean flow, the second term represents the transport of eddy kinetic energy by the eddies themselves, the third term represents the vertical transport of eddy kinetic energy, and the last term represents the dissipation of eddy kinetic energy.



The dissipation rate $\epsilon$ can be estimated from the turbulence kinetic energy equation as:



$$

\epsilon = \nu \left( \frac{\partial u'}{\partial x} \right)^2

$$



where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and $u'$ is the horizontal velocity perturbation.



The dissipation of atmospheric eddies is a complex process that involves the interaction of various physical mechanisms. It plays a crucial role in the energy balance of the atmosphere and has significant implications for the climate system. Understanding this process is essential for accurate weather prediction and climate modeling.



#### 7.2d Atmospheric Eddy Observations



Observing atmospheric eddies is a complex task due to their transient nature and the vast spatial scales they can cover. However, advancements in technology and modeling techniques have allowed us to gain a better understanding of these phenomena.



Atmospheric eddies can be observed through various methods, including satellite imagery, radar, and weather balloons. These methods provide data on wind speed and direction, temperature, and pressure, which can be used to identify and track eddies.



Satellite imagery, in particular, has been instrumental in observing large-scale eddies. The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is one such tool that has 10 filters available for observations. These filters can capture different wavelengths of light, allowing for a more detailed view of the atmosphere and the eddies within it.



In addition to observational data, numerical models are also used to study atmospheric eddies. These models, such as those based on the primitive equations, can simulate the dynamics of the atmosphere and predict the formation and evolution of eddies. The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis is one such model that has been widely used for this purpose.



Eddy permitting and eddy resolving models are particularly useful for studying the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the atmosphere. These models allow for the resolution of eddies and their effects on the mean flow. However, the resolution of these models is of great importance, as the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation can be underestimated if the resolution is not high enough.



Despite these advancements, there are still many uncertainties in our understanding of atmospheric eddies. For instance, the degree to which there is eddy compensation in the atmosphere is currently unknown. Further research and observations are needed to fully understand these complex phenomena and their impact on the climate system.



### Section: 7.3 Atmospheric Boundary Layers:



#### 7.3a Atmospheric Boundary Layer Structure



The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the part of the atmosphere that is directly influenced by the presence of the earth's surface and responds to surface forcings with a timescale of about an hour or less. It is the lowest part of the atmosphere and is typically a few hundred meters to a couple of kilometers deep, depending on the time of day and the geographical location.



The structure of the ABL is largely determined by the balance between mechanical turbulence, generated by wind shear, and buoyancy effects, which are related to the vertical gradient of air temperature. The ABL can be divided into two main layers: the surface layer and the Ekman layer.



The surface layer is the lowest part of the ABL, typically extending up to about 10% of the total ABL height. In this layer, the wind speed increases with height, and the temperature decreases with height during the day and increases with height at night. The surface layer is characterized by a high degree of turbulence, which is primarily generated by frictional drag at the earth's surface.



Above the surface layer is the Ekman layer, which extends up to the top of the ABL. In this layer, the wind speed and direction are influenced by the Coriolis effect, which causes the wind to veer to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The Ekman layer is less turbulent than the surface layer, and its structure is more influenced by the large-scale atmospheric pressure gradient.



The structure of the ABL is highly variable and depends on a variety of factors, including the time of day, the geographical location, the weather conditions, and the nature of the underlying surface. For example, over the ocean, the ABL is typically deeper and more turbulent than over land, due to the higher heat capacity and roughness of the ocean surface.



The structure of the ABL is of great importance for a variety of applications, including weather forecasting, air pollution dispersion, and wind energy production. Understanding the structure of the ABL and the processes that control its evolution is a key aspect of atmospheric science.



In the next section, we will discuss the equations that govern the dynamics of the ABL, including the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. These equations, known as the boundary layer equations, are a simplified version of the primitive equations that were discussed in the previous chapter.



#### 7.3b Atmospheric Boundary Layer Dynamics



The dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are governed by a complex interplay of various physical processes. These include the effects of turbulence, the Coriolis effect, pressure gradients, and the interaction with the earth's surface. 



Turbulence in the ABL is primarily generated by wind shear and buoyancy effects. Wind shear refers to the change in wind speed or direction with height, which can lead to the generation of turbulent eddies. Buoyancy effects, on the other hand, are related to the vertical gradient of air temperature. Warmer air tends to rise, and cooler air tends to sink, which can also generate turbulence. 



The Coriolis effect, due to the earth's rotation, also plays a significant role in the dynamics of the ABL. This effect causes the wind to veer to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection of the wind can influence the development and structure of the ABL, particularly in the Ekman layer.



Pressure gradients, both horizontal and vertical, can also influence the dynamics of the ABL. A pressure gradient force (PGF) is created when there is a difference in atmospheric pressure across a distance. This force can drive the wind from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, contributing to the overall wind pattern in the ABL.



The interaction with the earth's surface is another important factor in the dynamics of the ABL. The surface roughness and heat capacity of the underlying surface can influence the generation of turbulence and the vertical profiles of wind speed and temperature in the ABL. For example, over the ocean, the ABL is typically deeper and more turbulent than over land, due to the higher heat capacity and roughness of the ocean surface.



The dynamics of the ABL can be described mathematically using the primitive equations of atmospheric motion, which are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations. These equations take into account the effects of wind, pressure, temperature, and moisture, as well as the Coriolis effect and the earth's curvature. 



For example, the horizontal momentum equations in the primitive equations can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - fv = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + F_x

$$



$$

\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + fu = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + F_y

$$



where $u$ and $v$ are the components of the wind velocity in the x and y directions, respectively, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the air density, and $F_x$ and $F_y$ are the frictional forces in the x and y directions, respectively.



These equations, along with the other primitive equations, can be used to model the dynamics of the ABL and to predict its behavior under different atmospheric conditions. However, due to their complexity, these equations are often solved numerically using computer models.



#### 7.3c Atmospheric Boundary Layer Mixing



The mixing within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is a crucial process that significantly influences the vertical profiles of various atmospheric quantities such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This mixing is primarily driven by turbulence, which is generated by wind shear and buoyancy effects, as discussed in the previous section.



The mathematical representation of the mixing process in the ABL can be described using the conservation equation for a passive scalar in the convective boundary layer (CBL). This equation is given by:



$$

\frac {\partial \bar {c}}{\partial t}=-\frac {\partial \overline {w'c'}}{\partial z}

$$



where $\bar {c}$ is the mean of quantity $c$, which could be water vapor mixing ratio $q$, potential temperature $\theta$, eastward-moving $u$ and northward-moving $v$ wind speed. $\overline {w'c'}$ is the vertical turbulent flux of $c$.



This equation is derived under several approximations including the Bousinesq approximation, which ignores the density change due to pressure perturbation and keeps the density change due to temperature change. This is a fairly good approximation in the CBL. Other approximations include ignoring the body source, assuming horizontal homogeneity, and no subsidence. While these approximations may not always hold in the real CBL, they are acceptable in theoretical research.



Observations show that turbulent mixing accounts for 50% of the total variation of potential temperature in a typical CBL. However, due to the randomness of turbulences and our lack of knowledge about the exact physical behavior of it, parameterization of turbulent transport is needed in model simulation. 



Unlike shear dominated turbulence in the surface layer, large eddies associated with the rise of warm air parcels that transport heat from hot to cold, regardless of the local gradient of the background environment, exist in the mixed layer. Hence, the non-local counter-gradient transport should be properly represented in the model simulation.



Several approaches are generally followed in numerical models to obtain the vertical profiles and temporal variations of these quantities. These approaches involve the use of turbulence closure schemes, which are sets of equations that describe the effects of turbulence on the mean flow. These schemes can be either local, which only consider the effects of turbulence at a single point, or non-local, which consider the effects of turbulence over a larger spatial scale. The choice of the closure scheme depends on the specific characteristics of the ABL and the objectives of the simulation.



#### 7.3d Atmospheric Boundary Layer Observations



Observations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are crucial for understanding its behavior and the processes that occur within it. These observations can be made using a variety of methods, including remote sensing, in-situ measurements, and numerical modeling.



Remote sensing techniques, such as satellite imagery and radar, provide a broad view of the ABL and can capture large-scale phenomena. For instance, satellite observations have been instrumental in understanding mesoscale cellular convection (MCC), a form of buoyantly driven convection that provides the planetary boundary layer with cumulus clouds at the top of the boundary layer. MCC generally occurs over ocean regions and is primarily found off the coasts of major continents, particularly in North and South America. Satellite images from TIROS have helped to highlight the differences between laboratory convection cells and those that occur in the atmosphere, showing that eddy diffusion of heat and momentum dominate the atmospheric cells.



In-situ measurements, on the other hand, provide detailed, localized data about the ABL. These measurements can be made using a variety of instruments, such as weather balloons, anemometers, and thermometers, and can provide information about temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other atmospheric variables. These measurements are crucial for understanding the vertical profiles of these variables and the mixing processes that occur within the ABL.



Numerical modeling is another important tool for studying the ABL. These models, which are based on the primitive equations of fluid dynamics, can simulate the behavior of the ABL under a variety of conditions. They can also be used to test hypotheses and make predictions about the ABL's behavior. However, these models are only as good as the data they are based on, and they rely on parameterizations of turbulent transport due to the randomness of turbulences and our lack of knowledge about the exact physical behavior of it.



In conclusion, observations of the ABL, whether through remote sensing, in-situ measurements, or numerical modeling, are crucial for understanding the processes that occur within it and their impact on the larger atmosphere and climate system.



### Section: 7.4 Atmospheric Internal Waves



Atmospheric internal waves, also known as gravity waves, are a significant component of atmospheric turbulence. They are generated when stable, stratified flow is disturbed by an obstacle such as a mountain or hill. These waves can propagate vertically and horizontally, transporting energy and momentum throughout the atmosphere.



#### 7.4a Atmospheric Internal Wave Generation



The generation of atmospheric internal waves is a complex process that involves the interaction of various atmospheric parameters. When a stable, stratified flow encounters an obstacle, it is forced to rise. As the air rises, it cools and becomes denser than the surrounding air, causing it to sink back down. This oscillation between rising and sinking generates waves in the atmosphere.



The mathematical representation of this process is based on the primitive equations of fluid dynamics, which describe the motion of a fluid on a rotating sphere. These equations are:



$$

\frac{Du}{Dt} - fv = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + F_x

$$



$$

\frac{Dv}{Dt} + fu = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + F_y

$$



$$

\frac{Dw}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} - g + F_z

$$



$$

\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = -\rho (\nabla \cdot \vec{V})

$$



where $D/Dt$ is the material derivative, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $u$, $v$, and $w$ are the components of the velocity vector $\vec{V}$ in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively, $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $F_x$, $F_y$, and $F_z$ are the components of the external force vector.



The generation of atmospheric internal waves is also influenced by the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The ABL is the lowest part of the atmosphere, where the effects of the surface (such as friction and heat transfer) are significant. The turbulence within the ABL can enhance the generation of internal waves, particularly in the presence of strong wind shear.



In the next section, we will discuss the propagation of these atmospheric internal waves and their role in atmospheric turbulence.



#### 7.4b Atmospheric Internal Wave Propagation



The propagation of atmospheric internal waves is a fascinating phenomenon that involves the transfer of energy and momentum through the atmosphere. The propagation of these waves is influenced by various factors, including the stratification of the atmosphere, the Coriolis effect, and the presence of wind shear.



The propagation of atmospheric internal waves can be described mathematically using the wave equation, which is derived from the primitive equations of fluid dynamics. The wave equation for atmospheric internal waves is given by:



$$

\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 \phi

$$



where $\phi$ is the wave function, $t$ is time, $c$ is the speed of sound in the atmosphere, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.



The solution to this equation gives the wave function as a function of time and position, which describes the propagation of the wave through the atmosphere. The wave function can be complex, representing both the amplitude and phase of the wave.



The propagation of atmospheric internal waves is also influenced by the Coriolis effect, which is due to the rotation of the Earth. The Coriolis effect causes the wave to veer to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This effect can be incorporated into the wave equation by adding a term proportional to the Coriolis parameter $f$:



$$

\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} + f^2 \phi = c^2 \nabla^2 \phi

$$



Wind shear, which is a change in wind speed or direction with height, can also affect the propagation of atmospheric internal waves. Wind shear can cause the wave to refract, or change direction, as it propagates through the atmosphere. This effect can be modeled by adding a term to the wave equation that represents the wind shear.



In the next section, we will discuss the effects of atmospheric internal waves on weather and climate, and how these waves are observed and measured.



#### 7.4c Atmospheric Internal Wave Breaking



Atmospheric internal waves, while fascinating in their propagation, can also undergo a process known as wave breaking. This phenomenon is not only significant in the context of atmospheric dynamics but also plays a crucial role in the transfer of energy and momentum in the atmosphere.



Wave breaking typically occurs when the amplitude of the wave increases to a point where the wave becomes unstable, leading to a sudden and dramatic change in the wave's structure. This process is often associated with turbulence, as the breaking of the wave can lead to the generation of turbulent eddies.



The breaking of atmospheric internal waves can be described mathematically using the wave breaking criterion, which is derived from the wave equation. The wave breaking criterion for atmospheric internal waves is given by:



$$

\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} > \frac{1}{N}

$$



where $\phi$ is the wave function, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, and $N$ is the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, which is a measure of the stratification of the atmosphere.



When the vertical gradient of the wave function exceeds the inverse of the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, the wave is said to break. This condition represents a limit on the amplitude of the wave, beyond which the wave becomes unstable and breaks.



The breaking of atmospheric internal waves can have significant effects on the atmosphere. For example, the breaking of these waves can lead to the mixing of different layers of the atmosphere, which can affect the distribution of temperature, moisture, and other atmospheric properties. The breaking of atmospheric internal waves can also generate turbulence, which can influence the dynamics of the atmosphere and the weather.



In the next section, we will discuss the role of atmospheric internal waves in the general circulation of the atmosphere, and how these waves contribute to the transport of energy and momentum on a global scale.



#### 7.4d Atmospheric Internal Wave Observations



Observations of atmospheric internal waves are crucial for understanding their behavior, propagation, and impact on the atmosphere. These observations can be made through various methods, including satellite imagery, radar, and direct measurements from weather balloons or aircraft.



Satellite imagery provides a global view of atmospheric internal waves and can capture their large-scale features. For instance, the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope has filters that can be used to observe atmospheric internal waves. These observations can reveal the wave's amplitude, wavelength, and propagation direction.



Radar is another powerful tool for observing atmospheric internal waves. By sending out a signal and measuring the time it takes for the signal to bounce back, radar can provide information about the wave's altitude and velocity. This method is particularly useful for observing the vertical structure of atmospheric internal waves.



Direct measurements from weather balloons or aircraft can provide detailed information about the atmospheric conditions where the waves are propagating. These measurements can include temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed and direction. For example, during the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, observations from weather balloons and aircraft were used to study the role of atmospheric internal waves in the development and intensification of tropical cyclones.



In addition to these observational methods, numerical models can also be used to study atmospheric internal waves. These models can simulate the propagation and breaking of atmospheric internal waves, and can help to understand their impact on the atmosphere's general circulation.



Despite the advances in observational techniques and numerical modeling, there are still many challenges in observing and understanding atmospheric internal waves. These challenges include the difficulty of observing waves in the lower atmosphere, the complexity of the wave's interaction with the background flow, and the need for high-resolution data to capture the wave's small-scale features. However, continued research and observations are expected to provide further insights into the behavior and impact of atmospheric internal waves.



### Conclusion



Throughout this chapter, we have delved into the complex and fascinating world of atmospheric turbulence. We have explored the fundamental principles that govern this phenomenon, the various factors that contribute to its occurrence, and the significant role it plays in the broader context of atmospheric dynamics. 



We have seen that turbulence in the atmosphere is not a random or chaotic event, but rather a process governed by precise physical laws. It is a result of the interaction between different atmospheric layers, each with its own temperature, pressure, and wind speed. This interaction leads to the formation of eddies, which are the primary carriers of energy in a turbulent flow.



We have also discussed the impact of atmospheric turbulence on weather patterns and climate. Turbulence plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, moisture, and momentum in the atmosphere, influencing the formation of clouds, precipitation, and storms. Understanding atmospheric turbulence is therefore essential for accurate weather prediction and climate modeling.



In conclusion, atmospheric turbulence is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of our planet's atmosphere. Despite its complexity, the study of atmospheric turbulence is crucial for our understanding of weather patterns, climate change, and the overall functioning of our planet's atmospheric system.

## Chapter 8: Turbulence Modeling



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is a fundamental aspect of both the ocean and the atmosphere. It plays a crucial role in the transport and mixing of heat, momentum, and chemical species. Despite its significance, turbulence remains one of the most challenging aspects to model in the fields of oceanography and meteorology. This chapter, "Turbulence Modeling," aims to delve into the intricacies of this subject.



The chapter begins by providing a broad overview of turbulence, its characteristics, and its importance in the ocean and atmosphere. It then delves into the mathematical foundations of turbulence modeling, discussing the Navier-Stokes equations and the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The use of `$\tau_{ij}$` to represent the Reynolds stress tensor, a key component in these equations, will be explained in detail.



Following this, the chapter will explore various turbulence models, including the k-epsilon model, the k-omega model, and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Each model's strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate applications will be discussed, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of when and how to use each model.



The chapter will also discuss the challenges and limitations of turbulence modeling, such as the difficulty in accurately representing small-scale turbulent motions and the assumptions made in turbulence models. It will also touch upon the ongoing research and advancements in the field, highlighting the importance of continued study in this area.



In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of turbulence modeling, its mathematical foundations, various models, and the challenges faced in the field. It is hoped that this will provide readers with a solid foundation for understanding and applying turbulence models in their own research and work.



### Section: 8.1 Turbulence Closure Models



Turbulence closure models are essential in turbulence modeling as they provide a means to close the system of equations used to describe turbulent flows. These models are necessary because the exact equations of motion, the Navier-Stokes equations, are too complex to solve directly for most practical applications. 



#### 8.1a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations



The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are a form of the Navier-Stokes equations that have been averaged over time to remove the small-scale turbulent fluctuations. This simplification allows for the modeling of turbulent flows at a reduced computational cost.



The RANS equations are derived by decomposing the flow variables into a time-averaged component and a fluctuating component. For instance, for an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid, the continuity and momentum equations can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_i} = 0,

$$



and



$$

\frac{D \overline{u_i}}{Dt} = -\frac{\partial \left( \bar{p} + p' \right) }{\partial x_i} + \mu \left[ \frac{\partial^2 \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} \right].

$$



After averaging, the continuity and momentum equations become:



$$

\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_i} = 0,

$$



and



$$

\frac{D \overline{u_i}}{Dt} = -\frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i} + \mu \frac{\partial^2 \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j \partial x_j} - \frac{\partial \left( \rho \overline{u_i' u_j'} \right)}{\partial x_j},

$$



where $\rho \overline{u_i' u_j'}$ are the Reynolds stresses, which are collected with the viscous normal and shear stress terms, $\mu \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j}$.



The RANS equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluid in turbulent flow. However, they contain more unknowns than equations, which makes them impossible to solve without additional equations. These additional equations are provided by turbulence closure models, which are discussed in the following sections.



#### 8.1b Eddy Viscosity Models



Eddy viscosity models are a class of turbulence closure models that are based on the concept of turbulent or eddy viscosity. These models are used to approximate the Reynolds stresses in the RANS equations with the mean rate of deformation. 



One of the most widely used eddy viscosity models is the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. 



##### Spalart–Allmaras Turbulence Model



The Spalart–Allmaras model is a one-equation model that solves a transport equation for a modified turbulent viscosity, $\tilde{\nu}$. The turbulent eddy viscosity is given by:



$$

\frac{\partial \tilde{\nu}}{\partial t} + u_j \frac{\partial \tilde{\nu}}{\partial x_j} = C_{b1} [1 - f_{t2}] \tilde{S} \tilde{\nu} + \frac{1}{\sigma} \{ \nabla \cdot [(\nu + \tilde{\nu}) \nabla \tilde{\nu}] + C_{b2} | \nabla \tilde{\nu} |^2 \} - \left[C_{w1} f_w - \frac{C_{b1}}{\kappa^2} f_{t2}\right] \left( \frac{\tilde{\nu}}{d} \right)^2 + f_{t1} \Delta U^2

$$



where $f_{t1}$ and $f_{t2}$ are damping functions, $\tilde{S}$ is the vorticity magnitude, and $d$ is the distance from the closest surface. The constants in the model are determined from empirical data.



The Spalart–Allmaras model has been modified over the years to improve its performance. For instance, Spalart suggested using different values for the constants $C_{t3}$ and $C_{t4}$ to improve the model's safety. Other modifications include the DES (1999) and DDES (2006) models.



##### Model for Compressible Flows



The Spalart–Allmaras model can be adapted for compressible flows. In all cases, the turbulent dynamic viscosity is computed from $\mu_t = \rho \tilde{\nu}$, where $\rho$ is the local density. 



There are two main approaches to adapting the model for compressible flows. The first approach applies the original equation for $\tilde{\nu}$. In the second approach, the convective terms in the equation for $\tilde{\nu}$ are modified, but the right-hand side (RHS) remains the same as in the original model.



In the next section, we will discuss the Reynolds stress models, another class of turbulence closure models.



#### 8.1c Reynolds Stress Models



Reynolds Stress Models (RSM) are a class of turbulence closure models that solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses, rather than using an eddy viscosity concept. These models are based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, which are derived by decomposing the flow variables into a mean and a fluctuating component.



##### Reynolds Averaging of the Navier–Stokes Equations



For an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid, the continuity and momentum equations—the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations—can be written (in a non-conservative form) as:



$$

\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i} = 0,

$$



and



$$

\frac{D u_i}{D t} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_j},

$$



where $D/Dt$ is the Lagrangian derivative or the substantial derivative. 



Defining the flow variables with a time-averaged component and a fluctuating component, the continuity and momentum equations become:



$$

\frac{\partial \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_i} = 0,

$$



and



$$

\frac{D \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{D t} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \left( \bar{p} + p' \right) }{\partial x_i} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 \left( \overline{u_i} + u_i' \right)}{\partial x_j \partial x_j}.

$$



##### Advantages of RSM



The Reynolds Stress Models have several advantages over other turbulence models:



1) Unlike the k-ε model which uses an isotropic eddy viscosity, RSM solves all components of the turbulent transport. 



2) It is the most general of all turbulence models and works reasonably well for a large number of engineering flows.



3) It requires only the initial and/or boundary conditions to be supplied.



4) Since the production terms need not be modeled, it can selectively damp the stresses due to buoyancy, curvature effects etc.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specifics of the Reynolds Stress Models, discussing their formulation and application in various fluid dynamics scenarios.



#### 8.1d Large Eddy Simulation



Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a mathematical model used in computational fluid dynamics to simulate turbulence by filtering out the smaller scales of motion. This method is particularly useful in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, where the scales of motion can vary greatly.



##### Numerical Methods for LES



LES involves the solution to the discrete filtered governing equations using computational fluid dynamics. LES resolves scales from the domain size $L$ down to the filter size $\Delta$, and as such a substantial portion of high wave number turbulent fluctuations must be resolved. This requires either high-order numerical schemes, or fine grid resolution if low-order numerical schemes are used.



The question of how fine a grid resolution $\Delta x$ is needed to resolve a filtered velocity field $\overline{u}(\boldsymbol{x})$ is addressed in Chapter 13 of Pope. Ghosal found that for low-order discretization schemes, such as those used in finite volume methods, the truncation error can be the same order as the subfilter scale contributions, unless the filter width $\Delta$ is considerably larger than the grid spacing $\Delta x$. While even-order schemes have truncation error, they are non-dissipative, and because subfilter scale models are dissipative, even-order schemes will not affect the subfilter scale model contributions as strongly as dissipative schemes.



##### Filter Implementation



The filtering operation in LES can be implicit or explicit. Implicit filtering recognizes that the subfilter scale model will dissipate in the same manner as many numerical schemes. In this way, the grid, or the numerical discretization scheme, can be assumed to be the LES low-pass filter. While this takes full advantage of the grid resolution, and eliminates the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term, it is difficult to determine the shape of the LES filter that is associated with some numerical issues. Additionally, truncation error can also become an issue.



In explicit filtering, an LES filter is applied to the discretized Navier–Stokes equations, providing a well-defined filter shape and reducing the truncation error. However, this method requires additional computational resources to calculate the subfilter scale model term.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the specifics of the Large Eddy Simulation, discussing its formulation and application in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 8.2 Direct Numerical Simulation:



Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is another method used in computational fluid dynamics to simulate turbulence. Unlike Large Eddy Simulation (LES), DNS resolves all scales of motion in a turbulent flow, from the smallest Kolmogorov scales to the largest energy-containing scales. This makes DNS a highly accurate method for studying turbulence, but it also requires substantial computational resources.



#### 8.2a Basics of Direct Numerical Simulation



Direct Numerical Simulation involves solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluid substances, without any modeling or approximation. This means that all the spatial scales of the turbulent motion are resolved, from the smallest scales where viscosity is important (the Kolmogorov microscales) to the largest scales where the energy is input into the system.



The main advantage of DNS is its accuracy. Since it does not rely on any modeling or approximation, DNS can provide a detailed and accurate picture of turbulence. This makes it a valuable tool for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of turbulence and for validating turbulence models.



However, the main drawback of DNS is its computational cost. The number of grid points required for DNS scales with the Reynolds number to the power of 9/4, according to the formula:



$$

N \propto Re^{9/4}

$$



where $N$ is the number of grid points and $Re$ is the Reynolds number. This means that even for moderate Reynolds numbers, DNS requires a large number of grid points, which in turn requires substantial computational resources.



#### Numerical Methods for DNS



The numerical methods used for DNS are similar to those used for LES. They involve discretizing the Navier-Stokes equations using methods such as finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods. The choice of numerical method depends on the specific problem and the available computational resources.



One important aspect of DNS is the need for high-order numerical schemes. Since DNS resolves all scales of motion, it requires a high level of accuracy in the numerical discretization. Low-order schemes can introduce numerical errors that can contaminate the small-scale motions, which are crucial in DNS.



Another important aspect is the need for a fine grid resolution. The grid spacing $\Delta x$ must be small enough to resolve the smallest scales of motion. This requires a large number of grid points, which increases the computational cost of DNS.



Despite these challenges, DNS is a powerful tool for studying turbulence. It provides a detailed and accurate picture of turbulent flows, which can help to improve our understanding of turbulence and to develop more accurate turbulence models.



#### 8.2b Direct Numerical Simulation of Turbulent Flows



Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulent flows involves the numerical solution of the full, unfiltered Navier-Stokes equations. This approach is distinct from other methods such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), which involve some form of filtering or modeling to reduce the computational cost.



In DNS, the entire range of turbulent scales, from the smallest dissipative scales (Kolmogorov scales) to the largest energy-containing scales, are resolved. This requires a grid resolution that is fine enough to capture the smallest scales of turbulence, which can be extremely small, especially at high Reynolds numbers. The requirement for high grid resolution leads to a high computational cost for DNS, which scales with the Reynolds number as $N \propto Re^{9/4}$.



Despite its high computational cost, DNS provides a wealth of information about the turbulent flow. Since no modeling or approximation is involved, DNS can provide a detailed and accurate picture of the turbulence, including the complex interactions between different scales of motion. This makes DNS a valuable tool for studying the fundamental mechanisms of turbulence and for validating and improving turbulence models.



The numerical methods used for DNS are similar to those used for LES and DES. They involve discretizing the Navier-Stokes equations using methods such as finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods. The choice of numerical method depends on the specific problem and the available computational resources.



One important aspect of DNS is the need for accurate and stable numerical methods. Since DNS involves solving the full Navier-Stokes equations without any filtering or modeling, any numerical errors can have a significant impact on the results. Therefore, high-order numerical methods are often used in DNS to ensure accuracy and stability.



In conclusion, while DNS is computationally expensive, it provides the most accurate and detailed information about turbulent flows. This makes it an invaluable tool for studying turbulence and for improving turbulence models. However, due to its high computational cost, DNS is typically used for fundamental studies and for cases with relatively low Reynolds numbers. For practical engineering applications with high Reynolds numbers, other methods such as LES and DES are typically used.



#### 8.2c Direct Numerical Simulation of Turbulent Boundary Layers



Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is also a powerful tool for studying turbulent boundary layers. Turbulent boundary layers are regions near a solid surface where the flow is turbulent and the velocity varies from zero at the wall to the free stream value away from the wall. These regions are of great interest in many practical applications, such as the design of aircraft and ships, where the behavior of the boundary layer can significantly affect the performance and efficiency of the design.



In DNS of turbulent boundary layers, the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved without any modeling or filtering, just like in DNS of turbulent flows. However, the boundary conditions at the wall introduce additional complexity. The no-slip condition at the wall, which states that the velocity of the fluid at the wall is zero, leads to a very high gradient of velocity near the wall. This requires a very fine grid resolution near the wall to accurately capture the velocity gradient, which adds to the computational cost of DNS.



Despite the additional complexity and computational cost, DNS of turbulent boundary layers provides valuable insights into the behavior of turbulence near walls. It can reveal the detailed structure of the boundary layer, including the formation and evolution of turbulent structures such as streaks and vortices. It can also provide detailed information about the distribution of wall shear stress, which is a key parameter in many practical applications.



The numerical methods used for DNS of turbulent boundary layers are similar to those used for DNS of turbulent flows. They involve discretizing the Navier-Stokes equations using methods such as finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods. High-order numerical methods are often used to ensure accuracy and stability, especially near the wall where the velocity gradient is high.



In conclusion, while DNS of turbulent boundary layers is computationally expensive, it provides a wealth of detailed and accurate information about the behavior of turbulence near walls. This makes it a valuable tool for studying the fundamental mechanisms of wall turbulence and for improving turbulence models and design methods in practical applications.



#### 8.2d Direct Numerical Simulation of Turbulent Convection



Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is not only useful for studying turbulent boundary layers, but also for understanding turbulent convection. Turbulent convection is a phenomenon that occurs when heat is transferred through a fluid medium due to the fluid's motion. This process is crucial in many natural and industrial processes, such as the heat transfer in the ocean and atmosphere, the cooling of electronic devices, and the operation of heat exchangers.



In DNS of turbulent convection, the full Navier-Stokes equations, along with the energy equation, are solved without any modeling or filtering. The energy equation is crucial in this context as it accounts for the heat transfer due to both conduction and convection. The buoyancy force, which is the driving force for the fluid motion in turbulent convection, is included in the momentum equations. This force is proportional to the temperature difference between the fluid and its surroundings, which introduces an additional nonlinearity into the system of equations.



The numerical methods used for DNS of turbulent convection are similar to those used for DNS of turbulent flows and turbulent boundary layers. They involve discretizing the Navier-Stokes and energy equations using methods such as finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods. High-order numerical methods are often used to ensure accuracy and stability. 



Temporal discretization is typically done using explicit methods, such as the second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme, as described in the MEMO model. However, certain terms, such as the nonhydrostatic pressure perturbation and the vertical turbulent diffusion, may be treated implicitly to ensure stability and to avoid an unacceptable reduction of the time increment.



The boundary conditions for DNS of turbulent convection can be more complex than those for DNS of turbulent flows or turbulent boundary layers. They may include not only no-slip conditions for the velocity at the walls, but also thermal boundary conditions, such as constant temperature or constant heat flux conditions at the walls. These thermal boundary conditions can significantly affect the behavior of the turbulent convection.



Despite the additional complexity and computational cost, DNS of turbulent convection provides valuable insights into the behavior of turbulence in the presence of heat transfer. It can reveal the detailed structure of the convective flow, including the formation and evolution of turbulent structures such as plumes and thermal boundary layers. It can also provide detailed information about the distribution of temperature and heat flux, which are key parameters in many practical applications.



In conclusion, while DNS of turbulent convection is computationally demanding and requires careful handling of the boundary conditions and the nonlinearity introduced by the buoyancy force, it is a powerful tool for studying the complex interactions between turbulence and heat transfer.



### Section: 8.3 Large Eddy Simulation:



#### 8.3a Basics of Large Eddy Simulation



Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a mathematical model used in computational fluid dynamics to simulate turbulence by filtering out the smallest scales of the flow. This approach allows for the resolution of the large-scale structures that are most responsible for the energy transfer in a turbulent flow, while the effects of the smaller scales are modeled.



In LES, the governing equations are the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The filtering operation separates the flow field into resolved large-scale motions and unresolved subfilter-scale motions. The large-scale motions are directly resolved, while the subfilter-scale motions are modeled. This separation is achieved by applying a filter to the Navier-Stokes equations, which results in a filtered velocity field $\overline{u}(\boldsymbol{x})$.



The filter size $\Delta$ is a crucial parameter in LES. It determines the scales of motion that are resolved and those that are modeled. The filter size should be large enough to include the energy-containing eddies but small enough to allow for a feasible computational cost. The choice of the filter size is often guided by the available computational resources and the specific details of the flow being simulated.



The numerical methods used in LES are similar to those used in Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). They involve discretizing the filtered Navier-Stokes equations using methods such as finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods. However, due to the filtering operation, the discretization in LES needs to be performed with care to ensure that the truncation error does not dominate the subfilter scale contributions.



The filtering operation in LES can be either implicit or explicit. In implicit filtering, the numerical discretization scheme is assumed to act as the LES filter. This approach eliminates the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term but can lead to numerical issues. In explicit filtering, an LES filter is applied to the discretized Navier-Stokes equations, providing a well-defined filter shape and reducing the truncation error.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the numerical methods for LES, the implementation of the filtering operation, and the subfilter scale models used in LES.



#### 8.3b Large Eddy Simulation of Turbulent Flows



Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a powerful tool for simulating turbulent flows. The key to its success lies in its ability to resolve the large-scale structures of turbulence, which are responsible for most of the energy transfer, while modeling the smaller scales. This section will delve into the specifics of how LES is used to simulate turbulent flows.



The first step in LES of turbulent flows is to discretize the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. This is done using numerical methods such as finite difference, finite volume, or spectral methods. The choice of numerical method depends on the specific details of the flow being simulated and the available computational resources. However, it is important to note that the discretization must be performed with care to ensure that the truncation error does not dominate the subfilter scale contributions. This is particularly crucial when low-order discretization schemes are used, as the truncation error can be of the same order as the subfilter scale contributions unless the filter width $\Delta$ is considerably larger than the grid spacing $\Delta x$.



The next step is the implementation of the filter. As mentioned earlier, the filtering operation in LES can be either implicit or explicit. In implicit filtering, the numerical discretization scheme is assumed to act as the LES filter. This approach eliminates the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term but can lead to some numerical issues. For instance, it can be difficult to determine the shape of the LES filter, and truncation error can become an issue.



On the other hand, explicit filtering involves applying an LES filter to the discretized Navier-Stokes equations. This provides a well-defined filter shape and reduces the truncation error. However, it does come with the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term.



In both cases, the filter size $\Delta$ is a critical parameter. It determines the scales of motion that are resolved and those that are modeled. The filter size should be large enough to include the energy-containing eddies but small enough to allow for a feasible computational cost.



In conclusion, LES is a powerful tool for simulating turbulent flows. However, its success depends on careful implementation of the numerical methods and the filter. With the right approach, LES can provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of turbulence.



#### 8.3c Large Eddy Simulation of Turbulent Boundary Layers



Turbulent boundary layers present a unique challenge in the field of turbulence modeling. These layers, which form at the interface between a solid surface and a fluid, are characterized by a wide range of length and time scales. This makes them particularly difficult to simulate accurately using traditional turbulence models. However, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has proven to be a powerful tool for simulating these complex flows.



In LES of turbulent boundary layers, the first step is to discretize the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, as in any LES simulation. The choice of numerical method for this discretization will depend on the specific details of the boundary layer flow being simulated. However, it is crucial to ensure that the truncation error does not dominate the subfilter scale contributions, particularly when low-order discretization schemes are used. This can be achieved by ensuring that the filter width $\Delta$ is considerably larger than the grid spacing $\Delta x$.



The next step is the implementation of the filter. In turbulent boundary layers, the choice between implicit and explicit filtering can have significant implications. Implicit filtering, where the numerical discretization scheme is assumed to act as the LES filter, can be advantageous due to its lower computational cost. However, it can be difficult to determine the shape of the LES filter in this case, and truncation error can become an issue.



Explicit filtering, on the other hand, involves applying an LES filter to the discretized Navier-Stokes equations. This provides a well-defined filter shape and reduces the truncation error. However, it does come with the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term.



Regardless of the filtering method chosen, the filter size $\Delta$ is a critical parameter in LES of turbulent boundary layers. The filter size must be chosen carefully to ensure that the large-scale structures of turbulence, which are responsible for most of the energy transfer in the boundary layer, are adequately resolved.



In conclusion, LES is a powerful tool for simulating turbulent boundary layers. However, careful consideration must be given to the choice of numerical method, filtering implementation, and filter size to ensure accurate and efficient simulations.



#### 8.3d Large Eddy Simulation of Turbulent Convection



Turbulent convection, a phenomenon where turbulence and heat transfer are coupled, presents another unique challenge in turbulence modeling. This process is ubiquitous in both the atmosphere and the ocean, playing a crucial role in weather patterns, climate dynamics, and oceanic circulation. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has been increasingly used to study turbulent convection due to its ability to resolve the large-scale structures that dominate the energy and heat transport.



In LES of turbulent convection, the filtered Navier-Stokes equations are coupled with an energy equation that accounts for the heat transfer. The discretization of these equations is a critical step, and the choice of numerical method will depend on the specific details of the convective flow being simulated. As with LES of turbulent boundary layers, it is essential to ensure that the truncation error does not dominate the subfilter scale contributions. This can be achieved by ensuring that the filter width $\Delta$ is considerably larger than the grid spacing $\Delta x$.



The implementation of the filter in LES of turbulent convection follows similar principles as in LES of turbulent boundary layers. Implicit filtering can be advantageous due to its lower computational cost, but it can be challenging to determine the shape of the LES filter, and truncation error can become an issue. Explicit filtering provides a well-defined filter shape and reduces the truncation error, but it does come with the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term.



In turbulent convection, the filter size $\Delta$ is a critical parameter. It must be chosen carefully to ensure that the large-scale structures that dominate the energy and heat transport are adequately resolved. The subfilter scale model must also account for the effects of buoyancy, which can significantly influence the turbulence and heat transfer in convective flows.



In conclusion, LES is a powerful tool for studying turbulent convection, but it requires careful consideration of the numerical methods, filter implementation, and subfilter scale modeling. As our understanding and computational capabilities continue to improve, LES will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in our understanding of turbulent convection in the ocean and atmosphere.



### 8.4 Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulation



#### 8.4a Basics of Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulation



Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are a class of turbulence models that are based on the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluid. The RANS equations are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations through a process called Reynolds decomposition, where the instantaneous velocity is decomposed into its mean and fluctuating components. This decomposition allows for the averaging of the Navier-Stokes equations, leading to the RANS equations.



The RANS equations are given by:



$$

\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial t} + \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \overline{p}}{\partial x_i} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j^2} - \frac{\partial \overline{u'_i u'_j}}{\partial x_j}

$$



where $\overline{u_i}$ and $\overline{u_j}$ are the mean velocity components, $\overline{p}$ is the mean pressure, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\overline{u'_i u'_j}$ is the Reynolds stress tensor, which represents the effect of the turbulence on the mean flow.



The RANS equations are a set of partial differential equations that need to be solved numerically. The solution of these equations provides the mean velocity and pressure fields, which can be used to calculate quantities of interest such as the turbulent kinetic energy and the Reynolds stresses.



One of the main challenges in RANS simulations is the modeling of the Reynolds stresses. These stresses are unknown and need to be modeled in order to close the RANS equations. Various turbulence models have been developed for this purpose, including the k-epsilon and k-omega models, which are based on the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate.



In the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence, RANS simulations can provide valuable insights into the mean flow characteristics and the turbulence structure. However, it should be noted that RANS simulations are based on the assumption of statistical steadiness and homogeneity, which may not be valid in all cases. Therefore, the results of RANS simulations should be interpreted with caution, and the choice of turbulence model should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the flow being studied.



#### 8.4b Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulation of Turbulent Flows



In the simulation of turbulent flows, the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations play a crucial role. The RANS equations, as previously discussed, are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations through Reynolds decomposition. This decomposition allows for the averaging of the Navier-Stokes equations, leading to the RANS equations. 



The RANS equations are given by:



$$

\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial t} + \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \overline{p}}{\partial x_i} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j^2} - \frac{\partial \overline{u'_i u'_j}}{\partial x_j}

$$



where $\overline{u_i}$ and $\overline{u_j}$ are the mean velocity components, $\overline{p}$ is the mean pressure, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\overline{u'_i u'_j}$ is the Reynolds stress tensor, which represents the effect of the turbulence on the mean flow.



The RANS equations are a set of partial differential equations that need to be solved numerically. The solution of these equations provides the mean velocity and pressure fields, which can be used to calculate quantities of interest such as the turbulent kinetic energy and the Reynolds stresses.



One of the main challenges in RANS simulations is the modeling of the Reynolds stresses. These stresses are unknown and need to be modeled in order to close the RANS equations. Various turbulence models have been developed for this purpose, including the k-epsilon and k-omega models, which are based on the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate.



In the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence, RANS simulations can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of turbulent flows. These simulations can help us understand the complex interactions between different scales of motion in the ocean and atmosphere, and can provide valuable information for the prediction of weather and climate patterns.



However, it is important to note that RANS simulations have their limitations. They are based on the assumption of statistical homogeneity and isotropy, which may not always be valid in the ocean and atmosphere. Furthermore, the accuracy of RANS simulations depends on the accuracy of the turbulence models used to model the Reynolds stresses. Despite these limitations, RANS simulations remain a powerful tool in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### 8.4c Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulation of Turbulent Boundary Layers



The turbulent boundary layer is a region of fluid flow that is of particular interest in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations can be used to model these turbulent boundary layers, providing valuable insights into their behavior and dynamics.



The turbulent boundary layer is characterized by a high level of turbulence near the boundary, which gradually decreases as we move away from the boundary. The RANS equations, which we have discussed in the previous section, can be used to model this behavior. However, the modeling of the Reynolds stresses, which represent the effect of the turbulence on the mean flow, is a significant challenge in these simulations.



In the context of the RANS simulations, the turbulent boundary layer can be modeled using wall functions. These functions provide a relationship between the mean velocity and the distance from the wall, allowing for the modeling of the velocity profile in the boundary layer. The use of wall functions significantly reduces the computational cost of the simulations, as it allows for a coarser grid to be used near the wall.



The wall functions are derived from the law of the wall, which is an empirical law that describes the behavior of the mean velocity in the turbulent boundary layer. The law of the wall states that the mean velocity varies logarithmically with the distance from the wall. This law can be expressed as:



$$

\overline{u} = \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln \left( \frac{y}{y_0} \right)

$$



where $\overline{u}$ is the mean velocity, $y$ is the distance from the wall, $y_0$ is the roughness length, and $\kappa$ is the von Karman constant.



The wall functions are implemented in the RANS simulations by modifying the boundary conditions for the mean velocity. This modification allows for the accurate representation of the velocity profile in the turbulent boundary layer, leading to more accurate simulations of turbulent flows.



In the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence, the modeling of the turbulent boundary layers is of great importance. These layers play a crucial role in the transport of momentum, heat, and other quantities in the ocean and atmosphere. Therefore, the accurate modeling of these layers can significantly enhance our understanding of the dynamics of turbulent flows in these environments.



#### 8.4d Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulation of Turbulent Convection



Turbulent convection, a phenomenon that occurs in both the ocean and atmosphere, is characterized by the chaotic movement of fluid due to heat transfer. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations can be used to model this complex process, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of turbulent convection.



In the context of RANS simulations, turbulent convection can be modeled using the Boussinesq approximation. This approximation simplifies the Navier-Stokes equations by assuming that the fluid density is constant, except in the buoyancy term where it is proportional to the temperature difference. This simplification allows for the modeling of the buoyancy-driven flow, which is a key feature of turbulent convection.



The Boussinesq approximation can be expressed as:



$$

\rho = \rho_0 (1 - \beta (T - T_0))

$$



where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\rho_0$ is the reference density, $\beta$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $T$ is the fluid temperature, and $T_0$ is the reference temperature.



The RANS equations, combined with the Boussinesq approximation, can be used to model the velocity and temperature fields in turbulent convection. However, similar to the case of turbulent boundary layers, the modeling of the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat fluxes, which represent the effect of the turbulence on the mean flow and temperature, is a significant challenge in these simulations.



In the context of the RANS simulations, the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat fluxes can be modeled using turbulence models, such as the k-epsilon model or the k-omega model. These models provide closure to the RANS equations by expressing the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat fluxes in terms of the mean flow and temperature variables and the turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate.



The k-epsilon model, for example, can be expressed as:



$$

\tau_{ij} = -2 \mu_t S_{ij} + \frac{2}{3} k \delta_{ij}

$$



$$

q_i = - \rho C_p \frac{\mu_t}{\sigma_T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_i}

$$



where $\tau_{ij}$ is the Reynolds stress, $\mu_t$ is the turbulent viscosity, $S_{ij}$ is the mean strain rate, $k$ is the turbulence kinetic energy, $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, $q_i$ is the turbulent heat flux, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $C_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, $\sigma_T$ is the turbulent Prandtl number, and $T$ is the fluid temperature.



The use of turbulence models in the RANS simulations allows for the accurate representation of the velocity and temperature fields in turbulent convection, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of this complex process.

## Chapter 9: Turbulence Observations



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is a fundamental aspect of both the ocean and the atmosphere. It is a key player in the transport and mixing of heat, momentum, and chemical species, and thus, understanding its behavior is crucial for accurate weather forecasting, climate modeling, and oceanography. This chapter, "Turbulence Observations," aims to delve into the methods and techniques used to observe and measure turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



Observing turbulence is a challenging task due to its inherently unpredictable and transient nature. It requires sophisticated instruments and techniques that can capture the rapid changes in fluid velocity and pressure. The chapter will discuss various observational techniques, from traditional methods like anemometers and thermistors to advanced technologies like Doppler radar and LIDAR. 



Furthermore, the chapter will explore how these observations are used to develop and validate mathematical models of turbulence. These models, often based on the Navier-Stokes equations, are essential tools for predicting the behavior of turbulent flows. However, due to the complexity of turbulence, these models often require empirical adjustments based on observational data.



Finally, the chapter will highlight some of the key findings from turbulence observations in the ocean and atmosphere. These observations have led to significant advancements in our understanding of turbulence, from its role in the formation of weather systems to its impact on ocean currents and marine ecosystems.



In conclusion, "Turbulence Observations" will provide a comprehensive overview of the methods used to observe turbulence, the challenges associated with these observations, and the insights they have provided into the nature of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



### Section: 9.1 Oceanic Turbulence Observations:



#### 9.1a In-Situ Observations of Oceanic Turbulence



In-situ observations of oceanic turbulence are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the ocean and its interaction with the atmosphere. These observations are typically made using a variety of instruments that can measure the velocity, temperature, and salinity of the water at various depths. 



One of the key areas of interest in oceanic turbulence observations is the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The AMOC is a large-scale circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, characterized by the northward flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the Atlantic, and the southward flow of colder water in the deep Atlantic. This circulation plays a significant role in the global climate system, as it transports heat from the tropics to the higher latitudes.



In the Labrador Sea, deep convection during winter storms leads to the formation of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), a characteristically fresh water mass that forms at intermediate depths. This convection, however, does not penetrate into the North-East Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) layer, which forms the deep waters of the Labrador Sea. The LSW joins the NEADW to move southward out of the Labrador Sea, with some of the LSW being retained in the Subpolar Gyre (SPG). 



Observations of this process have shown that the production of LSW is highly dependent on the sea-air heat flux, with yearly production typically ranging from 3–9 Sv. Furthermore, the production of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) is sensitive to the density gradient across the Iceland-Scotland Ridge, and thus, is also affected by LSW production. 



Recent observations with the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) array have shown little contribution from the Labrador Sea to the AMOC. However, older estimates of LSW formation using different techniques suggest a larger overturning. This discrepancy highlights the challenges associated with observing oceanic turbulence and the need for continued research and development of observational techniques.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the methods and instruments used for in-situ observations of oceanic turbulence, and discuss how these observations are used to improve our understanding of the ocean's role in the global climate system.



#### 9.1b Remote Sensing of Oceanic Turbulence



Remote sensing is a powerful tool for observing oceanic turbulence, providing a global perspective that is unattainable with in-situ measurements alone. One of the key technologies used in remote sensing of oceanic turbulence is the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO). 



HICO uses 128 spectral bands from approximately 353 nm to 1080 nm wavelengths at 5.7 nm spectral resolution. The data from wavelengths less than 400 nm and greater than 900 nm are not recommended for analysis due to lower quality, while the 400-900 nm data are of higher quality. A smoothing filter is applied to the data to reduce noise and improve the quality of the observations.



The spatial resolution of HICO is approximately 90 meters, and each full scene covers approximately a 42 by 192 km rectangle. The International Space Station (ISS), which carries HICO, accomplishes about sixteen 90-minute orbits per day, and the location of the track for orbit moves to the west as earth rotates. The ISS orbit tracks over the same area on the ground about every three days, including nighttime overpasses. However, HICO imaging was limited to collect only one scene per orbit, resulting in about seven to eight daylight scenes per day, often spatially scattered throughout the world.



HICO data have a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 200-to-1 for water-penetrating wavelengths and assuming 5% albedo. The sensor had high sensitivity in the blue wavelengths and full coverage of water-penetrating wavelengths. This high signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity make HICO an effective tool for observing oceanic turbulence.



HICO collected satellite imagery from September 25, 2009, to September 13, 2014. A maximum of eight daylight scenes were collected per day. In any specific coastal region where scenes were imaged, temporal resolution is patchy. For example, over Chesapeake Bay on the United States east coast, 101 scenes were collected over the entire 5-year mission, and 16 scenes were imaged during the calendar year 2012.



The large datasets produced by HICO and other hyperspectral satellite datasets provide a wealth of information for studying oceanic turbulence. These datasets can be used to observe changes in oceanic turbulence over time and space, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the ocean and its interaction with the atmosphere.



#### 9.1c Laboratory Observations of Oceanic Turbulence



Laboratory observations of oceanic turbulence provide a controlled environment to study the complex dynamics of turbulence in the ocean. These observations are crucial to understanding the underlying physics of oceanic turbulence and validating the theoretical models and remote sensing observations.



One of the key laboratory techniques used to study oceanic turbulence is the use of stratified water tanks. These tanks are filled with layers of water with different salinities and temperatures to simulate the stratification of the ocean. A mechanical device is used to generate turbulence in the tank, and the resulting flow patterns and mixing processes are observed and measured.



The advantage of laboratory observations is the ability to control and manipulate the experimental conditions, which is not possible in field observations. For example, the stratification, turbulence intensity, and flow direction can be precisely controlled in the laboratory. This allows for a systematic study of the effects of these parameters on the turbulence dynamics.



However, laboratory observations also have limitations. The scale of the laboratory experiments is much smaller than the actual ocean, which may affect the turbulence dynamics. The boundary conditions in the laboratory are also different from those in the ocean. For example, the walls of the tank can affect the flow patterns and mixing processes. Therefore, the results of laboratory observations need to be interpreted with caution and validated with field observations and numerical simulations.



In the context of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), laboratory observations can provide insights into the convection and entrainment processes in the Labrador Sea. For example, the formation of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and North-East Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) can be simulated in the laboratory, and the effects of sea-air heat flux and density gradient on these processes can be studied. These laboratory observations can help to resolve the debate about the role of convection in the Labrador Sea in the AMOC circulation.



In conclusion, laboratory observations of oceanic turbulence are an essential tool in the study of oceanic turbulence. They provide a controlled environment to study the complex dynamics of turbulence, validate theoretical models and remote sensing observations, and gain insights into the processes involved in the AMOC circulation. However, the results of laboratory observations need to be interpreted with caution due to the differences in scale and boundary conditions between the laboratory and the ocean.



#### 9.1d Numerical Observations of Oceanic Turbulence



Numerical observations of oceanic turbulence are an essential tool in understanding the complex dynamics of turbulence in the ocean. These observations are made using computational models that simulate the physical processes in the ocean. The advantage of numerical observations is that they can simulate large-scale oceanic motions that are difficult to observe directly or reproduce in the laboratory.



One of the key computational models used in numerical observations of oceanic turbulence is the Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM). This model simulates the large-scale motions in the ocean by solving the primitive equations, which describe the conservation of momentum, heat, and salt in the ocean. The OGCM includes subgridscale (SGS) parameterization schemes to account for the effects of small-scale processes that are not resolved by the model.



The OGCM assumes that molecular friction rarely upsets the dominant balances in the ocean, such as the geostrophic and hydrostatic balances. This assumption is based on the fact that the Ekman number, which measures the ratio of viscous forces to Coriolis forces, is several orders of magnitude smaller than unity for large-scale oceanic motions. Similarly, the Reynolds number, which measures the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces, is negligible for the tracer equations, indicating that the molecular diffusive time scales are much longer than the advective time scale.



However, the OGCM recognizes that molecular friction is essential somewhere. Large-scale motions in the ocean interact with other scales through the nonlinearities in the primitive equations. This interaction leads to the closure problem, where new variables arise at each level in the Reynolds averaging procedure. The SGS parameterization schemes are used to account for these subgrid scale effects.



The SGS mixing schemes include filters and higher-order operators to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary. Special dynamical parameterizations, such as topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion, and convection, are also included in the model. These parameterizations are becoming available for certain processes, such as the surface mixed layer, which plays an important role in air-sea exchange.



Numerical observations of oceanic turbulence have limitations. The accuracy of the observations depends on the accuracy of the model and the parameterization schemes. The model assumptions and simplifications may also affect the results. Therefore, the results of numerical observations need to be validated with laboratory and field observations.



In the context of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), numerical observations can provide insights into the large-scale circulation patterns and the effects of turbulence on these patterns. For example, the formation and propagation of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and North-East Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW) can be simulated in the model, and the effects of sea-air heat flux and density gradient on these processes can be studied.



#### 9.2a In-Situ Observations of Atmospheric Turbulence



In-situ observations of atmospheric turbulence are crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of turbulence in the atmosphere. These observations are made using a variety of instruments and techniques, including radar and satellite imaging, which provide valuable data on the distribution and behavior of atmospheric water vapor, a key factor in atmospheric turbulence.



Radar and satellite imaging are particularly useful for observing atmospheric turbulence because they can provide a comprehensive view of the atmosphere over large areas and at various altitudes. As water molecules absorb microwaves and other radio wave frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates radar signals. This attenuation varies with the phase of the water (vapor, liquid, or solid) and the frequency of the radar signal, allowing for detailed observations of the distribution and behavior of water in the atmosphere.



For example, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-12) has been used to create images showing the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds, and continents of the Earth. These images reveal that water vapor is unevenly distributed around the planet, with the highest amounts appearing in dark blue and the lowest amounts appearing in yellow. This uneven distribution of water vapor is a key factor in the formation and behavior of atmospheric turbulence.



In addition to radar and satellite imaging, in-situ observations of atmospheric turbulence can also be made using weather balloons, aircraft, and ground-based instruments. These instruments measure a variety of atmospheric parameters, including temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, providing valuable data for understanding the dynamics of atmospheric turbulence.



However, in-situ observations of atmospheric turbulence have their limitations. For example, they are often limited in spatial and temporal resolution, and they can be influenced by local conditions and measurement errors. Therefore, in-situ observations are often complemented by numerical simulations and laboratory experiments, which can provide more controlled and detailed observations of atmospheric turbulence.



In conclusion, in-situ observations of atmospheric turbulence, combined with numerical simulations and laboratory experiments, provide a comprehensive approach to understanding the complex dynamics of turbulence in the atmosphere. This understanding is crucial for predicting and managing the impacts of atmospheric turbulence on weather, climate, and human activities.



#### 9.2b Remote Sensing of Atmospheric Turbulence



Remote sensing of atmospheric turbulence is a critical complement to in-situ observations, providing a broader and more comprehensive view of turbulence phenomena. This method involves the use of satellite-based instruments, such as the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO).



MIRI, equipped with 10 filters, allows for detailed observations of the atmosphere in the mid-infrared spectrum. This is particularly useful for studying the distribution of atmospheric water vapor, a key factor in atmospheric turbulence, as water molecules absorb mid-infrared radiation.



The AVHRR and its next-generation system, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), provide high-resolution images of the Earth's atmosphere. Operational experience with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites led to the development of AVHRR's follow-on, VIIRS. VIIRS is currently operating on board the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites, providing valuable data on atmospheric turbulence.



HICO, on the other hand, offers high spectral and spatial resolution data. It uses 128 spectral bands from approximately 353 nm to 1080 nm wavelengths at 5.7 nm spectral resolution. The spatial resolution of HICO pixels is approximately 90 meters, and each full scene covers approximately a 42 by 192 km rectangle. This high-resolution data is crucial for studying the fine-scale structures of atmospheric turbulence.



However, remote sensing of atmospheric turbulence also has its limitations. For instance, the data collected is often subject to atmospheric interference, such as cloud cover and aerosols. Moreover, the temporal coverage and resolution of satellite-based instruments can be limited, as they are dependent on the satellite's orbit and operational constraints.



Despite these limitations, remote sensing remains a vital tool for observing and understanding atmospheric turbulence. By combining remote sensing data with in-situ observations, scientists can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics of atmospheric turbulence.



#### 9.2c Laboratory Observations of Atmospheric Turbulence



Laboratory observations of atmospheric turbulence provide a controlled environment to study the complex dynamics of turbulence. These observations are often conducted in wind tunnels, thermal chambers, and other specialized facilities that can simulate various atmospheric conditions.



One of the key aspects of laboratory observations is the ability to control and manipulate the variables involved in the generation of turbulence. For instance, the temperature, pressure, and humidity can be precisely adjusted to study their effects on turbulence. This level of control is not possible in field observations or remote sensing, making laboratory observations a valuable tool in turbulence research.



In the context of atmospheric turbulence, one of the primary focuses is the study of water vapor. As mentioned in the previous section, water vapor plays a crucial role in atmospheric turbulence. Laboratory observations allow for a detailed study of how water vapor interacts with other atmospheric components under various conditions. For instance, the absorption of microwaves and other radio wave frequencies by water molecules, as well as the refraction and reflection of these signals by water in its different phases, can be studied in detail.



Furthermore, laboratory observations can also help in understanding the effects of atmospheric turbulence on radio wave propagation. As discussed earlier, radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience attenuation as they travel through the troposphere. This attenuation varies with the frequency of the radio waves and the composition of the atmosphere. Laboratory experiments can simulate these conditions and provide insights into how to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence on radio wave propagation.



However, it is important to note that laboratory observations also have their limitations. While they provide a controlled environment, they cannot fully replicate the vast and complex nature of the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, laboratory observations should be complemented with field observations and remote sensing to provide a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric turbulence.



In conclusion, laboratory observations of atmospheric turbulence are an essential part of turbulence research. They provide valuable insights into the dynamics of turbulence and help in developing models and strategies to predict and mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence. Despite their limitations, they remain a crucial tool in the study of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.



#### 9.2d Numerical Observations of Atmospheric Turbulence



Numerical observations of atmospheric turbulence are a critical component of turbulence research. These observations are typically conducted using computational models that simulate the complex dynamics of turbulence. The models are based on the primitive equations, which are a set of non-linear differential equations that describe the motion of fluid on a rotating sphere, such as the Earth's atmosphere or oceans.



One of the key advantages of numerical observations is the ability to simulate a wide range of atmospheric conditions and scenarios. For instance, the models can simulate turbulence at different altitudes, from low altitudes between 10 ft AGL and 1000 ft AGL, to medium and high altitudes of 2000 ft AGL and above. The models can also simulate the effects of various parameters, such as the wind speed at 20 ft, denoted as $W_{20}$, and the altitude AGL, denoted as "h".



The models use these parameters to calculate the length scales and turbulence intensities, which determine the shape of the power spectral densities and therefore the quality of the models' fit to spectra of observed turbulence. For example, at low altitude, the length scales are calculated as:



$$ 2L_w = h $$



$$ L_u=2L_v=\frac{h}{(0.177+0.000823h)^{1.2}} $$



And the turbulence intensities are calculated as:



$$ \sigma_w=0.1W_{20} $$



$$ \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_w}=\frac{\sigma_v}{\sigma_w}=\frac{1}{(0.177+0.000823h)^{0.4}} $$



At medium and high altitudes, the length scales and turbulence intensities are calculated differently. For the Dryden model, the length scales are calculated as:



$$ L_u=2L_v=2L_w=1750 \text{ft} $$



And for the von Kármán model, the length scales are calculated as:



$$ L_u=2L_v=2L_w=2500 \text{ft} $$



The turbulence intensities at high altitude are parameterized by the probability of exceedance.



These numerical observations provide valuable insights into the dynamics of atmospheric turbulence. However, it is important to note that these models are simplifications of the real world and may not capture all the complexities of atmospheric turbulence. Therefore, they should be used in conjunction with other methods, such as laboratory observations and field observations, to gain a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric turbulence.



#### 9.3a In-Situ Observations of Turbulence in Other Fluids



In-situ observations of turbulence in other fluids, such as water or oil, are crucial for understanding the dynamics of turbulent flow and diffusion. These observations are typically conducted using a variety of techniques, including non-intrusive methods such as planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV).



PLIF is a powerful technique that allows for the detection of instantaneous concentrations at up to one million points per second. This method involves the use of a laser to excite fluorescent molecules in the fluid, which then emit light at a different wavelength. By capturing this emitted light, researchers can determine the concentration of the fluorescent molecules and, by extension, the concentration of the fluid at different points in time and space.



PIV, on the other hand, is a technique that allows for the measurement of instantaneous velocity data. This method involves the use of a laser to illuminate particles in the fluid, and a high-speed camera to capture images of the particles at different points in time. By analyzing these images, researchers can determine the velocity of the particles and, by extension, the velocity of the fluid at different points in time and space.



These techniques can be used in conjunction to deduce spatial correlations and changes in the environment, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of turbulent flow and diffusion. For instance, by combining PLIF and PIV data, researchers can determine the relationship between the concentration and velocity of the fluid, which is crucial for understanding the process of turbulent diffusion.



In addition to these non-intrusive methods, in-situ observations of turbulence in other fluids can also be conducted using intrusive methods, such as hot-wire anemometry and laser Doppler velocimetry. These methods involve the insertion of probes into the fluid, which can measure parameters such as temperature and velocity.



Despite the challenges associated with in-situ observations of turbulence in other fluids, these methods have proved invaluable for studying the mixing cycles of contaminants in turbulent flows, especially for drinking water supplies. As technology and computational abilities continue to advance, these methods are expected to improve greatly, paving the way for more accurate and comprehensive models of turbulent diffusion.



#### 9.3b Remote Sensing of Turbulence in Other Fluids



Remote sensing is a powerful tool for observing turbulence in other fluids, particularly in the atmosphere and oceans. This method involves the use of radar and satellite imaging to detect and measure turbulence from a distance, without the need for direct contact with the fluid.



Radar and satellite imaging work by emitting signals that are reflected back by the fluid. The nature of these reflected signals can provide valuable information about the fluid's properties and behavior. For instance, water molecules absorb microwaves and other radio wave frequencies, which causes water in the atmosphere to attenuate radar signals. This attenuation can be measured and used to determine the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere.



In addition, atmospheric water can reflect and refract signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid, or solid. By analyzing these reflected and refracted signals, researchers can gain insights into the phase of the water and its distribution in the atmosphere. For example, a comparison of GOES-12 satellite images can show the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds, and continents of the Earth.



Remote sensing can also be used to observe turbulence in the ocean. For instance, radar signals can be used to measure the roughness of the ocean surface, which is influenced by wind speed and direction, current patterns, and other factors. By analyzing these measurements, researchers can gain insights into the dynamics of ocean turbulence and its effects on weather patterns, climate, and marine ecosystems.



In conclusion, remote sensing provides a powerful tool for observing turbulence in other fluids. By combining this method with in-situ observations and other techniques, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of turbulence and its effects on the environment.



#### 9.3c Laboratory Observations of Turbulence in Other Fluids



Laboratory observations of turbulence in other fluids have been instrumental in understanding the complex nature of turbulent flow and diffusion. These observations have been made possible through the use of advanced technologies and techniques, such as planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV).



PLIF is a non-intrusive technique that allows for the detection of instantaneous concentrations at up to one million points per second. This is achieved by using a laser to excite fluorescent molecules within the fluid, which then emit light at a different wavelength. The intensity of this emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of the fluorescent molecules, allowing for the measurement of concentration variations within the fluid.



PIV, on the other hand, is a technique that allows for the measurement of instantaneous velocity data. This is achieved by seeding the fluid with particles and then using a laser to illuminate a plane within the fluid. The particles scatter the laser light, which is then captured by a camera. By comparing subsequent images, the displacement of the particles can be determined, allowing for the calculation of their velocity.



These techniques, when used in conjunction, can provide a wealth of information about the turbulent flow within a fluid. For instance, they can be used to deduce spatial correlations and changes in the environment, which are crucial for understanding and modeling turbulent diffusion.



In addition to these laboratory techniques, real-time monitoring of turbulence, velocity, and currents for fluid mixing is now possible. This has proven to be particularly important for studying the mixing cycles of contaminants in turbulent flows, especially for drinking water supplies.



As technology and computational abilities continue to advance, these methods are expected to improve greatly. This will likely lead to more accurate and detailed observations of turbulence in other fluids, further enhancing our understanding of turbulent flow and diffusion.



In conclusion, laboratory observations of turbulence in other fluids are a crucial component of turbulence research. By combining these observations with other techniques, such as remote sensing and computer-aided modeling, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of turbulence and its effects on the environment.



#### 9.3d Numerical Observations of Turbulence in Other Fluids



Numerical observations of turbulence in other fluids have been made possible through the development and application of various turbulence models and computational methods. These models and methods have been instrumental in simulating and understanding the complex nature of turbulent flow and diffusion in various fluid systems.



One of the most commonly used turbulence models is the Spalart–Allmaras (S–A) model, which employs the Boussinesq hypothesis and uses only one additional equation to model turbulence viscosity transport. Other popular models include the "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon) and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models, which also employ the Boussinesq hypothesis but use two additional equations to model turbulence viscosity transport. These models offer a relatively low-cost computation for the turbulence viscosity $\nu_t$.



The SST two equation turbulence model developed by F.R. Menter has also been used extensively in numerical observations of turbulence. This model has been validated with experimental results, showing good agreement between mass-transfer simulations and experimental data for turbulent flow in rectangular and tubular shapes, a modified hydrocyclone, and curved rotating systems.



In addition to these turbulence models, various computational methods have been developed to simulate turbulent flows. One such method is the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), a grid-free Lagrangian method originally introduced to solve problems in astrophysics. This method has since been extended to simulate the compressible Euler equations in fluid dynamics and applied to a wide range of problems.



Another approach for solving fluid dynamic equations in a grid-free framework is the moving least squares or least squares method. These methods have been used to simulate inviscid incompressible free surface flows and other complex fluid systems.



These numerical observations of turbulence in other fluids have provided valuable insights into the behavior of turbulent flows and have been crucial in the development of more accurate and efficient turbulence models and computational methods. As technology and computational abilities continue to advance, these methods are expected to improve greatly, leading to more accurate and detailed observations of turbulence in various fluid systems.



#### 9.4a Laboratory Observations of Turbulence in Water



Laboratory observations of turbulence in water have been instrumental in understanding the complex nature of turbulent flow and diffusion. These observations have been made possible through the use of advanced technologies and techniques, such as planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV).



PLIF is a non-intrusive technique that allows for the detection of instantaneous concentrations at up to one million points per second. This technique is particularly useful in observing the turbulent diffusion of contaminants in water, as it allows for the real-time monitoring of concentration changes. When paired with PIV, which detects instantaneous velocity data, these techniques can be used to deduce spatial correlations and changes in the environment.



In addition to these techniques, computer-aided modeling and programming have been used to simulate turbulent flow in water. These simulations have been instrumental in developing models of turbulent diffusion, which have been difficult to obtain through traditional methods due to the ideal flow conditions involved.



One such model is the Spalart–Allmaras (S–A) model, which employs the Boussinesq hypothesis and uses only one additional equation to model turbulence viscosity transport. Other models, such as the "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon) and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models, also employ the Boussinesq hypothesis but use two additional equations to model turbulence viscosity transport. These models offer a relatively low-cost computation for the turbulence viscosity $\nu_t$.



The use of these techniques and models in laboratory observations of turbulence in water has provided valuable insights into the nature of turbulent flow and diffusion. These insights have been important in studying the mixing cycles of contaminants in turbulent flows, especially for drinking water supplies. As technology and computer abilities continue to expand, these methods are expected to improve greatly and will likely be at the forefront of future research on modeling turbulent diffusion.



#### 9.4b Laboratory Observations of Turbulence in Air



Laboratory observations of turbulence in air have been crucial in understanding the intricate dynamics of turbulent flow and diffusion in the atmosphere. These observations have been facilitated by the use of advanced technologies and techniques, such as hot-wire anemometry (HWA) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV).



HWA is a technique that measures velocity fluctuations in a fluid, in this case air, by noting the change in electrical resistance of a thin wire that is heated and then cooled by the fluid. This technique is particularly useful in observing the turbulent diffusion of particles in air, as it allows for the real-time monitoring of velocity changes. When paired with LDV, which measures the velocity of particles in a fluid using the Doppler shift in a laser beam, these techniques can be used to deduce spatial correlations and changes in the environment.



In addition to these techniques, computer-aided modeling and programming have been used to simulate turbulent flow in air. These simulations have been instrumental in developing models of turbulent diffusion, which have been difficult to obtain through traditional methods due to the ideal flow conditions involved.



One such model is the Dryden model, which is parameterized by a length scale and turbulence intensity. The combination of these two parameters determine the shape of the power spectral densities and therefore the quality of the model's fit to spectra of observed turbulence. Another model is the von Kármán model, which also uses length scale and turbulence intensity parameters, but is more applicable to higher altitudes.



For example, at low altitudes (between 10 ft AGL and 1000 ft AGL), the Dryden model uses the following equations for length scales and turbulence intensities:



$$

2L_w = h

$$



$$

L_u=2L_v=\frac{h}{(0.177+0.000823h)^{1.2}}

$$



$$

\sigma_w=0.1W_{20}

$$



$$

\frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_w}=\frac{\sigma_v}{\sigma_w}=\frac{1}{(0.177+0.000823h)^{0.4}}

$$



where "h" is the altitude AGL and "W"<sub>20</sub> is the wind speed at 20 ft.



At medium/high altitudes (2000 ft AGL and above), the Dryden model uses a constant length scale of 1750 ft, while the von Kármán model uses a constant length scale of 2500 ft.



The use of these techniques and models in laboratory observations of turbulence in air has provided valuable insights into the nature of turbulent flow and diffusion. These insights have been important in studying the mixing cycles of pollutants in turbulent flows, especially for air quality and climate studies. As technology and computer abilities continue to expand, these methods and models will continue to evolve and provide even more detailed observations and simulations of turbulence in the atmosphere.



#### 9.4c Laboratory Observations of Turbulence in Other Fluids



Laboratory observations of turbulence in other fluids, such as water and oil, have also been instrumental in understanding the dynamics of turbulent flow and diffusion. These observations have been made possible through the use of advanced technologies and techniques, such as planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV).



PLIF is a technique that is used to detect instantaneous concentrations at up to one million points per second. This technology can be paired with PIV, which detects instantaneous velocity data. These techniques can be used to deduce spatial correlations and changes in the environment, and are particularly useful in observing the turbulent diffusion of particles in fluids.



In addition to these techniques, computer-aided modeling and programming have been used to simulate turbulent flow in other fluids. These simulations have been instrumental in developing models of turbulent diffusion, which have been difficult to obtain through traditional methods due to the ideal flow conditions involved.



One such model is the Kolmogorov model, which describes the energy cascade in turbulent flow. This model is based on the assumption that at high Reynolds numbers, the smallest scales of turbulence are universally similar, regardless of the nature of the larger scales or the flow. The Kolmogorov model uses the following equations for the energy spectrum $E(k)$ and the dissipation rate $\epsilon$:



$$

E(k) = C \epsilon^{2/3} k^{-5/3}

$$



$$

\epsilon = 2 \nu \int_0^\infty k^2 E(k) dk

$$



where $C$ is the Kolmogorov constant, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $k$ is the wave number.



Another model is the RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) model, which is used to simulate turbulent flows by solving time-averaged equations of motion. This model is particularly useful in simulating turbulent flow in complex geometries, such as the flow around a ship hull or an airplane wing.



As technology and computer abilities continue to rapidly expand, these methods and models will also improve greatly, and will more than likely be at the forefront of future research on modeling turbulent diffusion.



#### 9.4d Laboratory Observations of Turbulence in Stratified Fluids



Laboratory observations of turbulence in stratified fluids, such as the ocean and atmosphere, have provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of these systems. Stratified fluids are characterized by layers of different densities, which can lead to the formation of turbulence under certain conditions. 



One of the key techniques used in laboratory observations of turbulence in stratified fluids is the Schlieren technique. This method allows for the visualization of density gradients in a fluid, which can be used to observe the formation and evolution of turbulence. The Schlieren technique involves passing a beam of light through the fluid and observing the resulting pattern of light and shadow, which corresponds to the density gradients in the fluid.



In the context of oceanic and atmospheric turbulence, laboratory observations have been particularly useful in studying the decay of open ocean convection and the formation of conical structures, or 'cones'. As discussed in the previous section, the decay of open ocean convection involves the weakening of sea-surface cooling and the onset of the restratification phase. Laboratory observations have shown that during this phase, the stratification takes up an ambient value around the periphery of the convective regime, while in the center of the 'chimney', the stratification is eroded away. This leads to the tilting of isopycnal surfaces towards the ocean's surface and the generation of a thermal wind, which sets up a rim current around the edge of the convection regime.



The formation of cones, on the other hand, occurs when the cooling of the surface and convective activity cease. Laboratory observations have shown that the chimney of homogenized cold water then erodes into several small conical structures, which propagate outward. These cones are thought to play a crucial role in the transport of heat and other properties in the ocean and atmosphere.



In addition to these observations, laboratory studies have also been instrumental in validating theoretical models of turbulence in stratified fluids. For instance, the Kolmogorov model and the RANS model, which were discussed in the previous section, have been tested and refined based on laboratory observations. These models provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex dynamics of turbulence in stratified fluids, and their validation through laboratory observations is a crucial step in their development.



In conclusion, laboratory observations of turbulence in stratified fluids have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of these systems, and have played a crucial role in the development and validation of theoretical models. As our understanding of these systems continues to grow, these observations will undoubtedly continue to play a vital role in advancing our knowledge of turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere.

## Chapter: Chapter 10: Turbulence in the Climate System



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is a fundamental aspect of the climate system. It plays a crucial role in the transport and mixing of heat, moisture, and momentum in the atmosphere and ocean. This chapter, "Turbulence in the Climate System," aims to delve into the intricate dynamics of turbulence and its profound implications on our understanding of the climate system.



Turbulence is ubiquitous in the climate system, manifesting in the swirling eddies of ocean currents, the gusty winds of a storm, and the convective updrafts in a cumulus cloud. It is a key player in the Earth's energy balance, influencing the distribution of solar radiation and the transport of heat from the equator to the poles. Understanding turbulence is, therefore, not just a theoretical exercise but a practical necessity for accurate climate modeling and prediction.



In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of turbulence, its characteristics, and its role in the climate system. We will discuss the mathematical models used to describe turbulence, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, and the challenges associated with their numerical simulation. We will also delve into the various methods used to measure and observe turbulence in the atmosphere and ocean.



The study of turbulence in the climate system is a vast and complex field, bridging the disciplines of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and atmospheric and oceanic sciences. It is a topic of ongoing research, with many unresolved questions and exciting possibilities. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject, serving as a foundation for further study and exploration.



As we navigate through the turbulent waters of this topic, we hope to shed light on the intricate dance of chaos and order that shapes our climate system. We invite you to join us on this journey, as we delve into the fascinating world of turbulence in the climate system.



### Section: 10.1 Turbulence and Climate Variability



#### Subsection: 10.1a Turbulence and El Niño-Southern Oscillation



The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a prime example of how turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere can influence climate variability. This phenomenon, which involves fluctuations in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressures across the equatorial Pacific, has far-reaching impacts on global weather patterns and climate.



El Niño events, characterized by warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific, can cause short-term spikes in global average surface temperature. Conversely, La Niña events, marked by cooler than average sea surface temperatures, can lead to short-term cooling. The relative frequency of these events can, therefore, affect global temperature trends on decadal timescales.



Recent studies suggest that the increased frequency and intensity of El Niño events over the last several decades may be linked to global warming. For instance, even after accounting for decadal variation, the amplitude of ENSO variability in observed data has increased by as much as 60% in the last 50 years[^1^]. A study by CSIRO researchers in 2023 found that climate change may have doubled the likelihood of strong El Niño events and increased the likelihood of strong La Niña events ninefold[^2^].



However, the future trends of ENSO under global warming are uncertain, as different models yield different predictions. Some suggest that the observed trend of more frequent and stronger El Niño events may only occur in the initial phase of global warming. As the lower layers of the ocean warm, El Niño events may become weaker. Alternatively, the stabilizing and destabilizing forces influencing ENSO may eventually balance each other out[^3^].



The role of turbulence in these processes is complex. Turbulence can enhance the mixing of heat and momentum in the ocean, potentially amplifying ENSO events. On the other hand, it can also dissipate energy and dampen these oscillations. Understanding the interplay between turbulence and ENSO is a challenging but crucial task for climate scientists.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mechanisms of ENSO and the role of turbulence in its dynamics. We will also discuss how changes in ENSO under global warming could affect turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere, and vice versa.

#### Subsection: 10.1b Turbulence and the North Atlantic Oscillation



The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is another significant example of how turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere can influence climate variability. The NAO is a weather phenomenon in the North Atlantic Ocean of fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Through east-west oscillation motions of the Icelandic Low and the Azores High, it controls the strength and direction of westerly winds and location of storm tracks across the North Atlantic[^4^].



Several methods have been proposed to remove the global trend and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence over the North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (SST). These methods aim to derive a revised Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index, which is a measure of North Atlantic SST anomalies[^5^]. 



Turbulence plays a significant role in the NAO and AMO. It can enhance the mixing of heat and momentum in the ocean, potentially amplifying these phenomena. On the other hand, turbulence can also dampen these oscillations by dispersing energy and heat across a wider area[^6^].



The AMO index suggests that the North Atlantic SST anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is equally divided between the externally forced component and internally generated variability[^7^]. However, other methodologies suggest that a large portion of the North Atlantic anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is externally forced[^8^].



Recent changes in the cooling of the subpolar gyre, warm temperatures in the subtropics, and cool anomalies over the tropics have increased the spatial distribution of meridional gradient in sea surface temperatures, which is not captured by the AMO Index[^9^]. This suggests that the AMO index may not fully capture the complexity of the North Atlantic's climate system and the role of turbulence in it.



In models, AMO-like variability is associated with small changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is a major driver of global climate patterns[^10^]. Turbulence in the ocean can influence the strength and stability of the AMOC, potentially affecting global climate on decadal to multidecadal timescales[^11^].



The future trends of NAO and AMO under global warming are uncertain, as different models yield different predictions. Some suggest that the observed trend of more frequent and stronger NAO and AMO events may only occur in the initial phase of global warming. As the lower layers of the ocean warm, these events may become weaker[^12^]. Alternatively, the stabilizing and destabilizing forces influencing NAO and AMO may eventually balance each other out[^13^].

#### Subsection: 10.1c Turbulence and the Madden-Julian Oscillation



The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a significant example of how turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere can influence climate variability. The MJO is a tropical disturbance that propagates eastward around the global tropics with a cycle of 30 to 60 days[^10^]. It is characterized by an eastward progression of large regions of both enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall, observed mainly over the Indian and Pacific Ocean[^11^].



In 2019, Rostami and Zeitlin reported a discovery of steady, long-living, slowly eastward-moving large-scale coherent twin cyclones, so-called equatorial modons, by means of a moist-convective rotating shallow water model[^12^]. The crudest barotropic features of MJO such as eastward propagation along the equator, slow phase speed, hydro-dynamical coherent structure, the convergent zone of moist-convection, are captured by Rostami and Zeitlin's modon[^12^].



In 2020, a study showed that the process of relaxation (adjustment) of localized large-scale pressure anomalies in the lower equatorial troposphere, generates structures strongly resembling the MJO events, as seen in vorticity, pressure, and moisture fields[^13^]. This process of adjustment, in the presence of strong moist convection, transforms a dipolar cyclonic structure into a coherent modon-like structure in the lower layer[^13^].



Turbulence plays a significant role in the MJO. It can enhance the mixing of heat and momentum in the ocean, potentially amplifying the MJO. On the other hand, turbulence can also dampen the MJO by dispersing energy and heat across a wider area[^14^].



The understanding of the MJO and its interaction with turbulence is crucial for accurate weather and climate predictions. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of the MJO, many aspects of its dynamics, structure, and impacts remain poorly understood. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of turbulence in the MJO and its impacts on global climate variability.

#### Subsection: 10.1d Turbulence and the Indian Ocean Dipole



The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), also known as the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole (SIOD), is a significant climate phenomenon that demonstrates the impact of turbulence on climate variability. The IOD is characterized by an anomalous cooling or warming of the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Indian Ocean[^15^]. 



The SIOD has been found to have a significant impact on rainfall patterns in southwestern Australia and southeastern Africa. In southwestern Australia, dry (wet) years correspond to anomalously cool (warm) waters in the tropical/subtropical Indian Ocean and anomalously warm (cool) waters in the subtropics off Australia[^16^]. These anomalies are in phase with the large-scale winds over the tropical/subtropical Indian Ocean, which modify SST anomalies through anomalous Ekman transport in the tropical Indian Ocean and through anomalous air–sea heat fluxes in the subtropics[^16^]. 



In southeastern Africa, positive SIOD events cause increased summer rains by bringing enhanced convergence of moisture. Higher temperature over the Southwestern Indian Ocean warm pole results in increased evaporation, and this moist air is advected to Mozambique and eastern South Africa, which is strengthened by the low pressure anomaly generated over this warm pole[^17^].



Turbulence plays a significant role in the IOD. It can enhance the mixing of heat and momentum in the ocean, potentially amplifying the IOD. On the other hand, turbulence can also dampen the IOD by dispersing energy and heat across a wider area[^18^]. 



The understanding of the IOD and its interaction with turbulence is crucial for accurate weather and climate predictions. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of the IOD, many aspects of its dynamics, structure, and impacts remain poorly understood. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of turbulence in the IOD.

#### Subsection: 10.2a Turbulence and Global Warming



Global warming, a significant aspect of climate change, is primarily driven by the increase in greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. This increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), traps more heat from the sun, leading to a rise in the Earth's average temperature[^19^]. 



Turbulence plays a crucial role in the distribution and transport of heat and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and oceans. In the atmosphere, turbulence can enhance the vertical mixing of heat and greenhouse gases, potentially amplifying the effects of global warming[^20^]. In the ocean, turbulence can affect the uptake and storage of heat and CO2, which can have significant implications for global warming[^21^].



Atmospheric and oceanic general circulation models (GCMs) are essential tools for studying the role of turbulence in global warming. These models simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice, and can incorporate the effects of turbulence through parameterizations[^22^]. For example, the HadCM3 and EdGCM models include parameterizations for processes such as convection and turbulent mixing that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly[^23^].



However, accurately representing turbulence in GCMs is a significant challenge due to its complex, multiscale nature. Turbulence can occur on scales ranging from millimeters to thousands of kilometers, and can involve a wide range of physical processes[^24^]. Therefore, improving our understanding of turbulence and its representation in GCMs is crucial for improving our predictions of global warming and its impacts.



In addition to GCMs, Earth-system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) and radiative-convective models (RCMs) can also be used to study the role of turbulence in global warming. For example, the Climber-3 model includes a statistical-dynamical representation of turbulence, while RCMs can be used to verify basic climate assumptions related to turbulence[^25^].



In conclusion, turbulence plays a significant role in global warming, and understanding its effects is crucial for accurate climate predictions. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of turbulence and its representation in climate models.

#### Subsection: 10.2b Turbulence and Sea Level Rise



Sea level rise, another significant aspect of climate change, has been observed globally with an increase of about 20 cm between 1901 and 2018[^25^]. More recent data from satellite radar measurements indicate an acceleration in the rate of sea level rise, with an average increase of 4.62 mm/yr for the decade 2013–2022[^26^].



Turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere plays a critical role in the dynamics of sea level rise. In the ocean, turbulence can influence the distribution and transport of heat and freshwater, which can affect sea level through changes in ocean density and circulation[^27^]. For instance, the warming of the Atlantic Ocean, which is occurring at a faster pace than the Pacific, has led to a sea level rise 3–4 times the global average along the U.S. East Coast and Europe[^28^].



In the atmosphere, turbulence can affect sea level indirectly through its impact on climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. Changes in these variables can alter the rates of glacier melt and ice sheet mass loss, which are major contributors to sea level rise[^29^]. For example, the loss of mass from melting glaciers reduces their gravitational pull, causing local water levels to drop near the glacier while increasing more than average further away[^30^].



General circulation models (GCMs) and Earth-system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) are valuable tools for studying the role of turbulence in sea level rise. These models can simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice, and can incorporate the effects of turbulence through parameterizations[^31^]. However, accurately representing turbulence in these models is a significant challenge due to its complex, multiscale nature[^32^].



In addition to natural processes, human activities such as the extraction of groundwater and oil and gas, as well as flood management practices, can also contribute to sea level rise. These activities can cause land subsidence, leading to a relative increase in sea level in areas built on river deltas[^33^]. Therefore, understanding the interactions between turbulence, climate change, and human activities is crucial for predicting future sea level rise and its impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems.



#### Subsection: 10.2c Turbulence and Ocean Acidification



Ocean acidification, a direct consequence of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption by the oceans, is another critical aspect of climate change. The process begins when CO2 dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid and subsequently reducing the pH of the water[^33^]. This phenomenon was observed during the Selli Event, where large-scale volcanic release of CO2 led to a drop in seawater pH, marking the onset of Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE1a)[^34^].



Turbulence in the ocean plays a significant role in the dynamics of ocean acidification. Turbulence can enhance the mixing and distribution of CO2 in the water column, thereby increasing the rate of acidification[^35^]. This process can have severe implications for marine life, particularly for calcifying organisms such as corals and shellfish, which struggle to build their shells and skeletons in more acidic conditions[^36^].



In the context of OAE1a, turbulence likely played a role in the distribution of the excess CO2 absorbed by the ocean, contributing to the widespread ocean acidification observed during this period[^37^]. This acidification may have been a factor in the significant decline of highly calcified nannoconids, although this causal relationship is disputed[^38^].



Turbulence can also influence the transport and distribution of nutrients in the ocean, which can indirectly affect ocean acidification. For instance, during the Selli Event, increased sulphate flux from volcanism led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which in turn increased phosphorus availability in the water column[^39^]. This increased nutrient availability can stimulate phytoplankton blooms, which absorb CO2 during photosynthesis and can therefore potentially mitigate some effects of ocean acidification[^40^].



However, accurately representing turbulence in models of ocean acidification is a significant challenge due to its complex, multiscale nature[^41^]. General circulation models (GCMs) and Earth-system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) are valuable tools for studying the role of turbulence in ocean acidification, but they require careful parameterization to accurately incorporate the effects of turbulence[^42^].



In conclusion, turbulence plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean acidification, influencing the distribution of CO2 and nutrients in the ocean. Understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting the future impacts of climate change on our oceans and developing effective strategies for mitigation[^43^].

#### Subsection: 10.2d Turbulence and Climate Feedbacks



Turbulence plays a significant role in the climate system, particularly in the context of climate feedbacks. Climate feedbacks are processes that can either amplify (positive feedback) or dampen (negative feedback) the initial climate response to a perturbation[^42^]. Two key climate feedbacks where turbulence plays a crucial role are the water vapor feedback and the cloud feedback.



##### Water Vapor Feedback



The water vapor feedback is a powerful positive feedback in the climate system. As the atmosphere warms due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, the saturation vapor pressure increases, leading to an increase in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere[^43^]. Since water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, this increase in water vapor content further warms the atmosphere, creating a positive feedback loop[^44^].



Turbulence in the atmosphere can enhance this feedback by increasing the mixing and distribution of water vapor. This process can lead to a more uniform distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere, thereby enhancing the greenhouse effect and further warming the atmosphere[^45^]. However, accurately representing this process in climate models is challenging due to the complex, multiscale nature of turbulence[^46^].



##### Cloud Feedback



Cloud feedback is another critical climate feedback where turbulence plays a significant role. Warming is expected to change the distribution and type of clouds, which can have a significant impact on the Earth's energy balance[^47^]. Low clouds tend to trap more heat at the surface and therefore have a positive feedback, while high clouds normally reflect more sunlight from the top so they have a negative feedback[^48^].



Turbulence can influence the formation, development, and dissipation of clouds. For instance, turbulence can enhance the vertical mixing of air, promoting the formation of low clouds[^49^]. On the other hand, turbulence can also lead to the breakup of clouds, particularly stratocumulus clouds, which can have a significant impact on the Earth's energy balance[^50^].



However, representing the effects of turbulence on clouds in climate models is a significant challenge. The complex, multiscale nature of turbulence makes it difficult to accurately represent in models, leading to uncertainties in the prediction of cloud feedback[^51^]. Despite these challenges, understanding the role of turbulence in climate feedbacks is crucial for improving our ability to predict future climate change[^52^].

#### 10.3a Turbulence and Tropical Cyclones



Tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons, are among the most powerful and destructive weather phenomena on Earth. These storms are characterized by intense low pressure, strong winds, and heavy rainfall, all of which are influenced by turbulence in the atmosphere and ocean[^50^].



Turbulence plays a crucial role in the formation, intensification, and movement of tropical cyclones. The initial formation of a tropical cyclone requires a pre-existing disturbance in the atmosphere, typically a tropical wave. Turbulence within this wave can enhance the vertical mixing of heat and moisture, promoting the development of deep convection and the formation of a cyclone[^51^].



Once a cyclone has formed, turbulence within the storm can contribute to its intensification. The strong winds of a cyclone generate turbulence in the boundary layer, the lowest part of the atmosphere. This turbulence enhances the transfer of heat and moisture from the ocean surface to the atmosphere, fueling the storm[^52^]. Furthermore, turbulence in the upper levels of the storm can influence the distribution of cloud particles and the size of the storm's anvil, as noted by Fovell et al. (2009)[^53^]. This can affect the storm's radiative balance and, consequently, its intensity and track[^54^].



Turbulence can also influence the movement or track of a tropical cyclone. The track of a cyclone is largely determined by the steering flow, the large-scale wind pattern in which the storm is embedded. Turbulence can modify this steering flow, leading to changes in the storm's track[^55^]. Additionally, as F09 noted, storms with stronger outer winds, which are influenced by turbulence, tend to track more to the northwest[^56^].



However, accurately representing the effects of turbulence in tropical cyclone models is a significant challenge. Turbulence is a complex, multiscale process that is not fully understood. Moreover, the effects of turbulence can be amplified or dampened by other factors, such as sea surface temperatures and the storm's internal dynamics[^57^]. Therefore, further research is needed to improve our understanding of turbulence in tropical cyclones and its representation in models.



In the next section, we will explore the role of turbulence in another extreme weather phenomenon: tornadoes.

#### 10.3b Turbulence and Tornadoes



Tornadoes, like tropical cyclones, are significantly influenced by atmospheric turbulence. These violent and destructive weather phenomena are characterized by a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud[^57^].



The formation of tornadoes is a complex process that involves several stages, each of which is influenced by turbulence. Initially, a change in wind direction and an increase in wind speed with increasing altitude creates an invisible, horizontal spinning effect in the lower atmosphere. This is known as wind shear[^58^]. Turbulence plays a crucial role in this stage by enhancing the vertical mixing of air masses with different temperatures and humidity levels[^59^].



Next, rising air within the thunderstorm updraft tilts the rotating air from horizontal to vertical, leading to the formation of a tornado[^60^]. Turbulence within the updraft can intensify this rotation and contribute to the development of a tornado[^61^].



Once a tornado has formed, turbulence within the tornado can influence its intensity and path. The strong winds within a tornado generate turbulence, which can enhance the transfer of heat and momentum from the surface to the atmosphere, fueling the tornado[^62^]. Furthermore, turbulence can influence the movement of a tornado. The path of a tornado is largely determined by the steering flow, the large-scale wind pattern in which the tornado is embedded. Turbulence can modify this steering flow, leading to changes in the tornado's path[^63^].



However, accurately representing the effects of turbulence in tornado models is a significant challenge. Turbulence is a complex, multiscale process that is not fully understood. Moreover, the effects of turbulence can vary greatly depending on the specific conditions of the atmosphere and the surface[^64^].



Despite these challenges, understanding the role of turbulence in tornadoes is crucial for improving tornado forecasts and warnings. This can help mitigate the devastating impacts of tornadoes, such as those experienced in the United States in 2017 and 2023[^65^].

#### 10.3c Turbulence and Thunderstorms



Thunderstorms, like tornadoes, are significantly influenced by atmospheric turbulence. These meteorological events are characterized by the presence of thunder, lightning, heavy rain, and sometimes even hail[^65^]. The formation, development, and dissipation of thunderstorms are all processes that are significantly affected by turbulence.



The formation of thunderstorms begins with the lifting of warm, moist air. This can occur due to several mechanisms, such as the heating of the Earth's surface, the presence of a front, or orographic lifting over mountains[^66^]. As this air rises, it cools and condenses to form a cumulonimbus cloud, the characteristic cloud of a thunderstorm[^67^]. Turbulence plays a crucial role in this stage by enhancing the vertical mixing of air masses with different temperatures and humidity levels[^68^].



Once a thunderstorm has formed, turbulence within the storm can influence its development and intensity. The updrafts and downdrafts within a thunderstorm are turbulent, leading to a chaotic and unpredictable flow of air[^69^]. This turbulence can enhance the transfer of heat and momentum within the storm, fueling its growth[^70^]. Furthermore, turbulence can contribute to the formation of severe weather phenomena associated with thunderstorms, such as tornadoes and hail[^71^].



The dissipation of a thunderstorm is also influenced by turbulence. As the storm matures, the downdrafts within the storm become stronger and more turbulent. This turbulence can disrupt the updraft, cutting off the supply of warm, moist air that fuels the storm[^72^]. Eventually, the storm dissipates, leaving behind only a remnant anvil cloud[^73^].



However, accurately representing the effects of turbulence in thunderstorm models is a significant challenge. Turbulence is a complex, multiscale process that is not fully understood. Moreover, the effects of turbulence can vary greatly depending on the specific conditions of the atmosphere and the surface[^74^].



Despite these challenges, understanding the role of turbulence in thunderstorms is crucial for improving weather forecasts and mitigating the impacts of severe weather. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interactions between turbulence and thunderstorms[^75^].



#### 10.3d Turbulence and Extreme Precipitation



Extreme precipitation events, such as heavy rainfalls and snowstorms, are another weather phenomenon significantly influenced by atmospheric turbulence. These events are characterized by high rates of precipitation that can lead to flooding and other severe impacts[^74^].



The formation of extreme precipitation events is closely tied to the presence of moisture in the atmosphere. Moisture-laden air masses can be lifted by various mechanisms, such as frontal systems or orographic lifting, leading to condensation and precipitation[^75^]. Turbulence plays a key role in this process by enhancing the vertical mixing of air masses, which can increase the amount of moisture available for precipitation[^76^].



Turbulence also influences the intensity and duration of extreme precipitation events. The turbulent nature of the atmosphere can lead to the formation of convective cells, which are regions of rising and sinking air that can enhance precipitation[^77^]. Furthermore, turbulence can lead to the formation of mesoscale convective systems, which are large, organized systems of thunderstorms that can produce heavy rainfall over a wide area[^78^].



The dissipation of extreme precipitation events is also influenced by turbulence. As the event progresses, the turbulent mixing of air can lead to the depletion of moisture, reducing the intensity of the precipitation[^79^]. Additionally, turbulence can disrupt the organization of convective systems, leading to their eventual dissipation[^80^].



However, accurately modeling the effects of turbulence on extreme precipitation events is a significant challenge. The multiscale nature of turbulence makes it difficult to represent in numerical weather prediction models, such as the Flow-following, finite-volume Icosahedral Model (FIM) or the Global Forecast System (GFS)[^81^]. Furthermore, the effects of turbulence can vary greatly depending on the specific conditions of the atmosphere, adding another layer of complexity to the problem[^82^].



Despite these challenges, understanding the role of turbulence in extreme precipitation events is crucial for improving our ability to predict these events and mitigate their impacts. Future research in this area will likely involve the development of more sophisticated models that can better represent the complex, multiscale nature of turbulence[^83^].

#### 10.4a Turbulence and Oceanic Carbon Uptake



Turbulence in the ocean plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, particularly in the process of oceanic carbon uptake[^82^]. This process involves the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by the ocean, where it is then stored in various forms, such as dissolved inorganic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon[^83^].



The efficiency of oceanic carbon uptake is largely determined by the intensity of turbulence in the ocean's surface layer[^84^]. Turbulence enhances the mixing of surface waters, which increases the contact between the ocean and the atmosphere, thereby facilitating the transfer of CO2 into the ocean[^85^]. This process is often referred to as gas exchange[^86^].



The role of turbulence in oceanic carbon uptake can be further understood through the concept of eddy diffusion. Eddy diffusion, as mentioned earlier, is a form of turbulent mixing that occurs in the ocean and is responsible for the vertical transport of heat, salt, and other substances, including carbon[^87^]. 



Eddy diffusion is particularly important in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, where it enables the upwelling of deep, carbon-rich waters to the surface[^88^]. This upwelling process is crucial for the ocean's ability to absorb atmospheric carbon. As these deep waters rise to the surface, they bring with them carbon that was previously dissolved in the ocean thousands of years ago[^89^]. 



At the same time, the turbulence caused by eddy diffusion allows for the dissolution and downwelling of present carbon-rich air, leading to a net accumulation of carbon in the ocean[^90^]. This process effectively moderates the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thus playing a significant role in Earth's climate system[^91^].



However, accurately quantifying the impact of turbulence on oceanic carbon uptake is a complex task. The multiscale nature of turbulence, combined with the vastness and depth of the ocean, makes it challenging to measure and model[^92^]. Despite these challenges, understanding the role of turbulence in the oceanic carbon cycle is crucial for predicting future changes in the Earth's climate system[^93^].



In the next section, we will explore the role of turbulence in the atmospheric carbon cycle and how it interacts with the oceanic carbon cycle.

#### 10.4b Turbulence and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide



Turbulence in the atmosphere also plays a significant role in the carbon cycle, particularly in the distribution and concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere[^92^]. 



Atmospheric turbulence, caused by factors such as wind shear, thermal convection, and orographic effects, can enhance the vertical and horizontal mixing of CO2[^93^]. This mixing process is crucial for maintaining the homogeneity of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, despite the spatial and temporal variability of CO2 sources and sinks[^94^].



The role of atmospheric turbulence in the carbon cycle can be further understood through the concept of eddy covariance. Eddy covariance is a method used to measure and quantify the exchange of gases, including CO2, between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface[^95^]. This method relies on high-frequency measurements of the vertical wind speed and the gas concentration, which are then used to calculate the flux of the gas[^96^].



Eddy covariance measurements have shown that turbulence can significantly influence the rate of CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface[^97^]. For example, during the day, thermal convection can enhance the upward flux of CO2 from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. Conversely, at night, when the atmosphere is often more stable, the downward flux of CO2 from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface can be reduced[^98^].



However, similar to the oceanic carbon uptake, accurately quantifying the impact of turbulence on atmospheric CO2 concentrations is a complex task. The multiscale nature of turbulence, combined with the variability of CO2 sources and sinks, makes this a challenging area of research[^99^].



Understanding the role of turbulence in the carbon cycle, both in the ocean and the atmosphere, is crucial for predicting future changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and, consequently, future climate change[^100^]. As such, further research in this area is of paramount importance.

#### 10.4c Turbulence and the Terrestrial Carbon Cycle



Turbulence plays a significant role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, particularly in the process of primary production[^101^]. Primary production, the creation of organic compounds from atmospheric or aquatic carbon dioxide, is a fundamental component of the carbon cycle. It is primarily driven by photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and algae, which convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into organic matter and oxygen[^102^].



Turbulence in the atmosphere can influence primary production in several ways. For instance, wind-induced turbulence can affect the distribution of heat and moisture in the atmosphere, which in turn can influence the photosynthetic activity of plants[^103^]. Moreover, turbulence can enhance the vertical mixing of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thereby affecting its availability for photosynthesis[^104^].



The impact of turbulence on the terrestrial carbon cycle can be quantified through the concept of Gross Primary Production (GPP). GPP is the total amount of carbon fixed by photosynthesis per unit area per unit time[^105^]. Eddy covariance measurements, which are used to quantify the exchange of gases between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface, have been used to estimate GPP at the ecosystem level[^106^].



According to these measurements, the terrestrial gross primary production was estimated to be 123±8 Gt carbon per year during 1998-2005[^107^]. This indicates that terrestrial ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, accounting for more than half of the total primary production on Earth[^108^].



However, accurately quantifying the impact of turbulence on the terrestrial carbon cycle is a complex task. The multiscale nature of turbulence, combined with the spatial and temporal variability of primary production, makes this a challenging area of research[^109^].



Understanding the role of turbulence in the terrestrial carbon cycle is crucial for predicting future changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and, consequently, future climate change[^110^]. As such, further research in this area is of utmost importance.

#### 10.4d Turbulence and the Global Carbon Budget



The global carbon budget is a balance sheet of carbon inputs and outputs in the Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, and oceans[^110^]. It is a critical component of the Earth's climate system, as it determines the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is a major driver of global warming[^111^]. Turbulence, both in the atmosphere and the ocean, plays a significant role in shaping the global carbon budget.



Atmospheric turbulence, as discussed in the previous section, can influence the terrestrial carbon cycle by affecting primary production[^112^]. Similarly, oceanic turbulence can influence the marine carbon cycle. For instance, turbulence in the ocean can enhance the vertical mixing of carbon dioxide, thereby affecting its dissolution in seawater and subsequent uptake by marine organisms[^113^]. Moreover, turbulence can influence the distribution of nutrients in the ocean, which can in turn affect marine primary production[^114^].



The global carbon budget is typically quantified in terms of Net Primary Production (NPP), which is the difference between Gross Primary Production (GPP) and the respiration of primary producers[^115^]. According to recent estimates, the global NPP is approximately 104.9 Gt carbon per year[^116^]. This indicates that the biosphere, including both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, is a significant sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide[^117^].



However, accurately quantifying the impact of turbulence on the global carbon budget is a complex task. The multiscale nature of turbulence, combined with the spatial and temporal variability of primary production and respiration, makes this a challenging area of research[^118^]. Moreover, the impact of turbulence on the carbon cycle can be modulated by other factors, such as temperature, light availability, and nutrient concentrations[^119^].



Despite these challenges, understanding the role of turbulence in the global carbon budget is crucial for predicting future changes in the Earth's climate system. As the Earth's climate continues to warm, changes in atmospheric and oceanic turbulence could have significant implications for the global carbon budget[^120^]. Therefore, further research in this area is needed to improve our understanding of the complex interactions between turbulence, the carbon cycle, and the climate system[^121^].

### Conclusion



In this chapter, we have delved into the complex and fascinating world of turbulence in the climate system. We have explored how turbulence, a seemingly chaotic and random phenomenon, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. It is clear that understanding turbulence is not just an academic exercise, but a necessity for accurate climate modeling and prediction.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Turbulence in Geophysical Fluids



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is a fundamental aspect of geophysical fluids, which include both the ocean and the atmosphere. This chapter, "Turbulence in Geophysical Fluids", aims to delve into the intricate dynamics of turbulence within these two critical components of our planet's system.



The ocean and the atmosphere are both fluid systems, albeit with different properties and scales. They are governed by the laws of fluid dynamics, and turbulence is a key feature of their behavior. Turbulence in these systems is not just a matter of academic interest; it has profound implications for weather prediction, climate modeling, oceanography, and even the transport of pollutants.



Understanding turbulence in geophysical fluids is a challenging task. It involves the study of a wide range of scales, from the smallest eddies to the largest ocean currents and atmospheric systems. It also requires a deep understanding of the fundamental equations of fluid dynamics, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluid substances. These equations, when applied to geophysical fluids, take on a complex form due to the rotation and stratification of the Earth, as well as the variable density of the fluids.



In this chapter, we will explore the nature of turbulence in geophysical fluids, its causes, and its effects. We will discuss the mathematical models used to describe and predict turbulence, and the challenges faced in their application. We will also look at the role of turbulence in the transport of heat, momentum, and substances within the ocean and the atmosphere.



This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of turbulence in geophysical fluids, a topic of great importance in the fields of meteorology, oceanography, and climate science. It is hoped that this exploration will not only deepen our understanding of our planet's fluid systems but also contribute to the development of more accurate models for predicting their behavior.



### Section: 11.1 Turbulence in the Earth's Core



The Earth's core, a region beneath the mantle, is divided into two parts: a solid inner core and a liquid outer core. Both parts contain significant quantities of iron. The liquid outer core, moving in the presence of the Earth's magnetic field, generates eddies due to the Coriolis effect. These eddies, in turn, produce a magnetic field that enhances the Earth's original magnetic field. This self-sustaining process is known as the geomagnetic dynamo.



#### 11.1a Turbulence and the Earth's Magnetic Field



The turbulence in the Earth's liquid outer core plays a crucial role in the generation and maintenance of the Earth's magnetic field. The turbulent motion of the liquid iron in the outer core, driven by thermal and compositional convection, generates electric currents. These currents, in turn, produce a magnetic field, as described by Ampère's law. 



The interaction between the magnetic field and the turbulent flow is governed by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. These equations describe the behavior of electrically conducting fluids, such as the molten iron in the Earth's outer core, in the presence of a magnetic field.



Glatzmaier and Paul Roberts have developed a supercomputer model of the Earth's interior based on the MHD equations. This model simulates the turbulent flow in the outer core and its effect on the Earth's magnetic field over thousands of years in virtual time. The results of these simulations are in good agreement with observations. They have correctly predicted that the Earth's magnetic field flips every few hundred thousand years. During these flips, the magnetic field does not disappear completely; instead, it becomes more complex.



The study of turbulence in the Earth's core and its effect on the magnetic field is not only of academic interest. It has practical implications as well. For instance, changes in the Earth's magnetic field can affect navigation systems, which rely on the magnetic field for direction. Furthermore, the magnetic field protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation. Understanding the turbulence in the Earth's core and its effect on the magnetic field can help us predict changes in the magnetic field and prepare for their potential impacts.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models used to describe turbulence in the Earth's core and the challenges faced in their application.



#### 11.1b Turbulence and the Geodynamo



The geodynamo, a self-sustaining process that generates the Earth's magnetic field, is largely influenced by the turbulence in the Earth's liquid outer core. The turbulent motion of the molten iron in the outer core, driven by thermal and compositional convection, generates electric currents. These currents, in turn, produce a magnetic field, as described by Ampère's law. 



The geodynamo process is a complex interplay of fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and thermodynamics. The turbulence in the outer core, caused by the rotation of the Earth and buoyancy forces, plays a crucial role in this process. The Coriolis effect, due to the Earth's rotation, gives rise to large-scale vortices in the outer core. These vortices, or eddies, interact with the magnetic field, leading to the generation and maintenance of the geodynamo.



The geodynamo process can be described by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. These equations describe the behavior of electrically conducting fluids, such as the molten iron in the Earth's outer core, in the presence of a magnetic field. The MHD equations are a set of partial differential equations that combine the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.



The geodynamo process is not a steady-state process. It is characterized by periods of relative stability, known as normal polarity epochs, interspersed with periods of rapid change, known as geomagnetic reversals. During these reversals, the Earth's magnetic field does not disappear completely; instead, it becomes more complex and multi-polar before re-establishing itself with the opposite polarity.



The study of turbulence in the Earth's core and its effect on the geodynamo is not only of academic interest. It has practical implications as well. For instance, changes in the Earth's magnetic field can affect navigation systems, which rely on the magnetic field for direction finding. Furthermore, the Earth's magnetic field provides a shield against harmful solar radiation. Understanding the geodynamo process can help us predict changes in the Earth's magnetic field and prepare for their potential impacts.



#### 11.1c Turbulence and Core-Mantle Coupling



The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is a region of intense interaction between the Earth's liquid outer core and the solid mantle. This interaction, known as core-mantle coupling, is largely influenced by the turbulence in the Earth's outer core. The turbulent motion of the molten iron in the outer core, driven by thermal and compositional convection, can induce flow in the overlying mantle, leading to a coupling between the two layers.



The core-mantle coupling can be described by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, which describe the behavior of electrically conducting fluids, such as the molten iron in the Earth's outer core, in the presence of a magnetic field. The MHD equations are a set of partial differential equations that combine the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.



The core-mantle coupling has significant implications for the Earth's magnetic field and geodynamics. For instance, the turbulence in the outer core can induce flow in the overlying mantle, leading to changes in the Earth's magnetic field. These changes can, in turn, affect the geodynamo process, which generates the Earth's magnetic field.



Moreover, the core-mantle coupling can influence the Earth's rotation and tectonic activity. The turbulent motion in the outer core can induce torques on the mantle, leading to changes in the Earth's rotation rate. This can have significant implications for the Earth's tectonic activity, as changes in the rotation rate can affect the stress distribution in the Earth's crust, leading to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.



The study of turbulence in the Earth's core and its effect on the core-mantle coupling is not only of academic interest. It has practical implications as well. For instance, changes in the Earth's magnetic field, induced by the core-mantle coupling, can affect navigation systems, which rely on the magnetic field for direction finding. Furthermore, changes in the Earth's rotation rate, induced by the core-mantle coupling, can affect the Earth's climate, as changes in the rotation rate can influence the distribution of solar radiation on the Earth's surface.



#### 11.1d Turbulence and the Earth's Rotation



The Earth's rotation is a fundamental aspect of our planet's dynamics, influencing everything from the distribution of sunlight and heat across the globe to the behavior of weather systems. The rotation of the Earth is not a constant, but rather a variable that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the turbulence in the Earth's core.



The Earth's rotation is primarily driven by the conservation of angular momentum, a fundamental principle of physics that states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted upon by an external torque. However, the Earth's rotation can also be influenced by internal processes, such as the turbulent motion of the molten iron in the Earth's outer core.



The turbulence in the Earth's outer core, driven by thermal and compositional convection, can induce torques on the mantle, leading to changes in the Earth's rotation rate. This process, known as core-mantle coupling, can be described by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, which combine the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.



The changes in the Earth's rotation rate induced by the core-mantle coupling can have significant implications for the Earth's geodynamics. For instance, changes in the rotation rate can affect the stress distribution in the Earth's crust, leading to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Moreover, changes in the rotation rate can influence the Earth's magnetic field, which in turn can affect navigation systems that rely on the magnetic field for direction finding.



The study of turbulence in the Earth's core and its effect on the Earth's rotation is a complex and challenging field of research. It requires a deep understanding of fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and geophysics, as well as sophisticated numerical models and high-performance computing resources. However, the insights gained from this research can provide valuable information about the Earth's past, present, and future, and can help us better understand and predict natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of turbulence in the Earth's core in shaping the Earth's magnetic field, and how this can influence the Earth's climate and weather patterns.



#### 11.2a Turbulence and Mantle Convection



Mantle convection is a critical process in the Earth's geodynamics, driving the movement of tectonic plates and contributing to phenomena such as volcanism and seismic activity. The turbulence within this convection process plays a significant role in the heat transfer from the Earth's core to its surface, and thus, understanding this turbulence is crucial for a comprehensive study of geophysical fluids.



The mantle convection process is primarily driven by the thermal gradient between the lower and upper mantle. The lower mantle, being hotter and thus less dense, rises towards the surface, while the cooler and denser upper mantle sinks. This convective motion is slow, occurring at rates of centimeters per year, and a complete cycle of convection takes hundreds of millions of years.



Turbulence within the mantle convection process can be described using the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the motion of viscous fluid substances. The equations can be written as:



$$

\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g}

$$



where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $t$ is time, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $p$ is the pressure, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration.



The turbulence in the mantle convection process can lead to complex and chaotic fluid motions, which can significantly affect the heat transfer process. The turbulence can enhance the heat transfer by increasing the mixing of the fluid and breaking down the thermal boundary layers. This can lead to a more efficient heat transfer from the Earth's core to its surface, which can influence the Earth's climate and weather patterns.



Moreover, the turbulence in the mantle convection process can also affect the Earth's geodynamics. For instance, the turbulent motion can induce stresses on the tectonic plates, leading to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The turbulence can also influence the Earth's magnetic field, which can affect navigation systems that rely on the magnetic field for direction finding.



The study of turbulence in the mantle convection process is a challenging field of research, requiring a deep understanding of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and geophysics. However, the insights gained from this research can provide valuable information about the Earth's geodynamics and climate, and can contribute to our understanding of other planets and celestial bodies.



#### 11.2b Turbulence and Plate Tectonics



The turbulence within the mantle convection process not only influences the heat transfer from the Earth's core to its surface but also plays a significant role in plate tectonics. The turbulent motion within the mantle can induce stresses on the tectonic plates, leading to earthquakes and volcanic activity.



Plate tectonics is the theory that explains the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is broken into several large and small pieces known as tectonic plates. These plates float on the semi-fluid layer of the mantle, and their movement is driven by the convective currents within the mantle. The turbulence within these convective currents can influence the speed, direction, and intensity of the plate movements.



The interaction between tectonic plates can lead to various geodynamic events. For instance, when two plates collide, it can lead to the formation of mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate is forced underneath the continental plate in a process known as subduction, leading to volcanic activity. On the other hand, when two plates move apart, it can create a gap that allows magma to rise from the mantle, forming new crust. This process, known as seafloor spreading, is responsible for the creation of mid-ocean ridges.



The turbulence within the mantle convection process can influence these geodynamic events. For instance, the turbulent motion can enhance the subduction process by increasing the downward pull on the oceanic plate. This can lead to more intense volcanic activity and the formation of deeper ocean trenches. Similarly, the turbulence can enhance the seafloor spreading process by increasing the upward push on the magma, leading to the formation of larger mid-ocean ridges.



In conclusion, the turbulence within the mantle convection process plays a crucial role in the Earth's geodynamics. Understanding this turbulence can provide valuable insights into the future of the Earth, including the movement of continents, the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanic activity, and the changes in the Earth's climate and weather patterns.



#### 11.2c Turbulence and the Earth's Heat Budget



The Earth's heat budget is a delicate balance between the incoming solar radiation and the outgoing terrestrial radiation. This balance is crucial for maintaining the Earth's average temperature and, consequently, its climate. Turbulence in the Earth's mantle, as discussed in the previous section, plays a significant role in the Earth's heat budget by influencing the heat transfer from the Earth's core to its surface.



The mantle convection process, characterized by turbulent motion, is a primary mechanism for heat transfer within the Earth. This process involves the movement of heat from the Earth's core to its surface through the mantle. The heat from the core heats the lower part of the mantle, causing it to become less dense and rise towards the surface. As it cools, it becomes denser and sinks back towards the core, creating a convective cycle. This turbulent convection process is responsible for transferring a significant amount of heat from the Earth's core to its surface, contributing to the Earth's heat budget.



The heat transferred to the surface through mantle convection is not evenly distributed. The turbulence within the mantle can cause variations in the heat flux at the surface, leading to temperature variations. These temperature variations can influence the atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, which in turn can affect the Earth's climate.



For instance, studies have shown that the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the oceans, which is a significant component of the Earth's heat budget, is highly correlated with changes in the strength of the mantle convection. Johns et al. (2009) reported that the MOC accounted for nearly 90% of the total heat transport in the North Atlantic, with the remainder contained in a quasi-stationary gyre pattern.



Climate models, such as the general circulation model (GCM), take into account the heat transfer from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere and the oceans. These models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice, including the heat transfer processes. The turbulence in the mantle, and its influence on the Earth's heat budget, can be incorporated into these models to provide a more accurate prediction of the Earth's climate.



In conclusion, the turbulence in the Earth's mantle plays a crucial role in the Earth's heat budget by influencing the heat transfer from the Earth's core to its surface. Understanding this turbulence and its effects on the Earth's heat budget can provide valuable insights into the Earth's climate and its changes.



#### 11.2d Turbulence and the Earth's Magnetic Field



The Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is a complex and dynamic entity that plays a crucial role in protecting the planet from harmful solar radiation. The generation and maintenance of this magnetic field are primarily attributed to the turbulent motion within the Earth's liquid outer core, a process known as the geomagnetic dynamo.



The geomagnetic dynamo is a self-sustaining process that involves the conversion of kinetic energy from the turbulent motion of the liquid outer core into magnetic energy. This process is governed by the principles of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a field of study that combines the laws of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.



The liquid outer core, composed mainly of iron, moves in the presence of the Earth's magnetic field. This movement, influenced by the Coriolis effect, sets up eddies or turbulent flows within the core. These eddies, in turn, generate their own magnetic fields, which reinforce and sustain the Earth's overall magnetic field.



Supercomputer models of the Earth's interior, such as the one developed by Glatzmaier and Paul Roberts, have been instrumental in studying the dynamics of the geomagnetic dynamo. These models, which simulate the turbulent motion within the Earth's core over thousands of years, have successfully predicted the periodic flipping of the Earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon observed in the geological record.



During these magnetic field reversals, the field does not disappear but becomes more complex. This complexity is a direct result of the turbulent nature of the fluid motion within the Earth's core. The turbulence disrupts the existing magnetic field, leading to a period of multiple magnetic poles before eventually settling into a new configuration with the magnetic poles flipped.



The turbulence within the Earth's core and its effect on the geomagnetic field have far-reaching implications. For instance, changes in the Earth's magnetic field can influence the behavior of charged particles in the Earth's magnetosphere, affecting phenomena such as the auroras and space weather.



Moreover, there have been reports of correlations between turbulence in the Earth's core, changes in the geomagnetic field, and seismic activity. Some monitoring stations have reported spikes in ultra-low frequency (ULF) activity, which is influenced by the Earth's magnetic field, preceding earthquakes. However, more research is needed to understand these correlations and their potential use in earthquake prediction.



In conclusion, turbulence in the Earth's mantle and core plays a significant role in the generation and dynamics of the Earth's magnetic field. Understanding these turbulent processes and their effects on the geomagnetic field is crucial for understanding the Earth's geophysical processes and their impact on our planet's climate, seismic activity, and space weather.



#### 11.3a Turbulence and Atmospheric Circulation



Turbulence plays a significant role in the Earth's atmospheric circulation, influencing weather patterns, climate, and the transport of heat and moisture. The Earth's atmosphere is a complex system of fluid dynamics, where the interaction of various forces results in the formation of eddies and turbulent flows. 



The Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) is a key component of the Earth's climate system, transporting heat from the tropics to the poles. Studies have shown that the strength of the MOC is highly correlated with changes in the meridional heat transport, with the circulation accounting for nearly 90% of the total heat transport (Johns et al., 2009). The variability of the MOC, as observed by Kanzow and colleagues (2007) and Cunningham et al. (2007), indicates the presence of turbulence in the ocean-atmosphere system.



In the Southern Ocean, the Residual Meridional Overturning Circulation (RMOC) is a crucial factor in the Antarctic Circumpolar Circulation. The RMOC is a streamfunction that quantifies the transport of tracers across isopycnals, taking into account the effects of wind stress. The RMOC is the sum of the Eulerian mean MOC $\bar{\Psi}$ and eddy-induced bolus overturning $\Psi^*$. The Eulerian mean MOC is dependent on the meridional winds that drive Ekman transport in the zonal direction, while the eddy-induced bolus overturning acts to restore sloping isopycnals to the horizontal, which are induced by eddies.



The turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, much like the turbulence in the Earth's core, has far-reaching implications. It influences the transport of heat and moisture, the formation of weather systems, and the dynamics of the Earth's climate system. Understanding the role of turbulence in atmospheric circulation is therefore crucial for predicting weather patterns and understanding climate change. 



In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of turbulence in the oceanic circulation and its impact on the Earth's climate system.



#### 11.3b Turbulence and Weather Systems



Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere is a key driver of weather systems. The chaotic and unpredictable nature of turbulence can lead to the formation of severe weather events such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. 



The formation of these weather systems is largely due to the interaction of turbulent eddies with the larger scale atmospheric flow. For instance, in the case of thunderstorms, warm, moist air near the surface of the Earth rises and cools, forming a cumulonimbus cloud. The turbulent eddies within the cloud can lead to the formation of a thunderstorm cell, which can produce severe weather conditions including heavy rain, lightning, and even tornadoes (Doswell III et al., 1996).



Turbulence also plays a crucial role in the formation of tornadoes. The interaction of turbulent eddies with the larger scale atmospheric flow can lead to the formation of a mesocyclone, a rotating updraft that is a precursor to the formation of a tornado (Markowski and Richardson, 2010). 



Hurricanes, on the other hand, are formed when warm, moist air over the ocean rises and cools, leading to the formation of a tropical cyclone. The turbulent eddies within the cyclone can intensify the storm, leading to the formation of a hurricane (Emanuel, 2003).



The role of turbulence in the formation of these weather systems is complex and not fully understood. However, it is clear that turbulence plays a crucial role in the Earth's weather systems and understanding this role is key to improving weather forecasts and climate models.



In the next section, we will explore the role of turbulence in the ocean's currents and how it affects the Earth's climate system.

#### 11.3c Turbulence and Climate Variability



Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans plays a significant role in the variability of the Earth's climate. The chaotic and unpredictable nature of turbulence can lead to significant changes in the Earth's climate system, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns.



One of the key ways in which turbulence affects the Earth's climate is through its impact on the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). The MOC is a system of ocean currents that transports heat from the tropics to the poles, playing a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. Turbulence within the MOC can lead to significant variability in the transport of heat, with potential impacts on global climate patterns.



For instance, Kanzow and colleagues (2007) demonstrated the effectiveness of the MOC in transporting heat, reporting that the sum of the transports into the North Atlantic from March 2004 to March 2005 varied with a root-mean-square value of only 3.4 Sv (where 1 Sv = a flow of ocean water of $10^6$ cubic meters per second) as compared to expected measurement errors of 2.7 Sv. This suggests that turbulence within the MOC can lead to significant variability in the transport of heat, with potential impacts on the Earth's climate.



Similarly, Johns et al. (2009) concluded that the meridional heat transport was highly correlated with changes in the strength of the MOC, with the circulation accounting for nearly 90% of the total heat transport. This suggests that turbulence within the MOC can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate, potentially leading to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.



However, the relationship between turbulence and climate variability is complex and not fully understood. While climate models predict a weakening of the MOC under global warming scenarios, they often struggle to match observations or reconstructions of the current. For instance, the observed decline in the MOC strength in the period 2004–2014 was a factor 10 higher than that predicted by climate models participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This suggests that our understanding of the role of turbulence in the Earth's climate system is still evolving, and further research is needed to fully understand this complex relationship.



In the next section, we will explore the role of turbulence in the ocean's currents and how it affects the Earth's climate system.

#### 11.3d Turbulence and Climate Change



Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans not only plays a significant role in climate variability but also in climate change. The complex interactions between turbulence and the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) can have profound impacts on the Earth's climate system, potentially exacerbating the effects of global warming.



The MOC, as a major heat transport system, is particularly sensitive to changes in turbulence. As we have seen, studies by Kanzow et al. (2007) and Johns et al. (2009) have shown that turbulence within the MOC can lead to significant variability in the transport of heat, which can in turn affect global climate patterns. However, the relationship between turbulence and the MOC is not static and can be influenced by changes in the Earth's climate.



Climate models predict a weakening of the MOC under global warming scenarios, which could potentially lead to a decrease in the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. This could have significant impacts on the Earth's climate, potentially leading to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. However, these models often struggle to match observations or reconstructions of the current, suggesting that our understanding of the relationship between turbulence, the MOC, and climate change is still incomplete.



For instance, direct observations of the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) have been available only since 2004 from the RAPID array, an in situ mooring array at 26°N in the Atlantic. The observed decline in the period 2004–2014 was of a factor 10 higher than that predicted by climate models participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This discrepancy between observations and model predictions highlights the need for further research into the role of turbulence in the Earth's climate system.



In conclusion, while turbulence plays a significant role in the Earth's climate system, our understanding of its impacts on climate change is still evolving. Further research is needed to improve our climate models and to better understand the complex interactions between turbulence, the MOC, and the Earth's climate.



### Section: 11.4 Turbulence in the Earth's Oceans:



#### 11.4a Turbulence and Ocean Circulation



Turbulence in the Earth's oceans plays a crucial role in the global climate system, particularly in the context of ocean circulation. The ocean circulation system is a complex network of currents, eddies, and gyres that transport heat, salt, and nutrients around the globe. Turbulence, as a fundamental aspect of fluid dynamics, is integral to these processes.



One of the key components of ocean circulation is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the world's largest ocean current, which is primarily driven by wind forcing. The ACC is subject to a phenomenon known as eddy saturation, where the mean current remains insensitive to changes in wind stress. This is due to the balance between the wind-driven Ekman transport and the eddy-induced transport.



Alongside the ACC, the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) is another significant component of the ocean circulation system. The MOC is also primarily driven by wind forcing and exhibits a similar insensitivity to wind stress changes, a phenomenon referred to as eddy compensation. However, it is important to note that eddy saturation and eddy compensation are distinct dynamical mechanisms, and the occurrence of one does not necessarily entail the occurrence of the other.



Eddy permitting and eddy resolving models are used to examine the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC. These models have shown that the MOC response is more sensitive to model resolution than the ACC transport. However, the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC and MOC is still not fully understood due to the lack of high-resolution ocean observations.



Deep convection is another important process in the ocean that is influenced by turbulence. This process involves the downward movement of colder, denser water, which helps to drive the thermohaline circulation. Deep convection is distinguished into small-scale processes, represented by plumes, and mesoscale processes, represented by chimneys (patches) and eddies.



In conclusion, turbulence plays a significant role in the Earth's ocean circulation system. It influences the dynamics of major ocean currents such as the ACC and MOC, and it is integral to processes such as deep convection. However, our understanding of these processes and their sensitivity to changes in turbulence is still incomplete, highlighting the need for further research in this area.



#### 11.4b Turbulence and Oceanic Eddies



Oceanic eddies are another significant manifestation of turbulence in the Earth's oceans. These are large rotating structures that are formed by the instability of ocean currents. Eddies play a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients across the ocean basins, thereby influencing the global climate system.



Eddies are also closely related to the phenomena of eddy saturation and eddy compensation. Eddy saturation refers to the balance between the wind-driven Ekman transport and the eddy-induced transport, which results in the insensitivity of the mean current to changes in wind stress. On the other hand, eddy compensation refers to the near independence of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) to the increase of wind stress. 



Eddies are primarily generated by baroclinic instability, a process that is driven by the density gradient in the ocean. The energy for the formation of eddies is derived from the potential energy associated with this density gradient. The size, intensity, and lifespan of eddies can vary greatly, depending on the specific conditions of the ocean and atmosphere.



Eddy permitting and eddy resolving models are used to study the role of eddies in the ocean. These models have shown that the MOC response is more sensitive to model resolution than the ACC transport. However, the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC and MOC is still not fully understood due to the lack of high-resolution ocean observations.



In the context of turbulence, eddies contribute to the mixing and dispersion of properties such as heat, salt, and nutrients in the ocean. This mixing process is crucial for the maintenance of the ocean's stratification and the global climate system. However, the exact mechanisms and impacts of eddy-induced mixing are still a topic of ongoing research.



In conclusion, turbulence and eddies play a crucial role in the dynamics of the Earth's oceans. They influence the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients, the ocean's stratification, and the global climate system. Further research and high-resolution observations are needed to fully understand these complex processes and their impacts on our planet.



#### 11.4c Turbulence and Ocean Mixing



Turbulence plays a significant role in the mixing of the ocean's waters, a process that is crucial for the distribution of heat, salt, and nutrients. This mixing process is primarily driven by the interaction of large-scale oceanic motions with other scales, facilitated by the nonlinearities in the primitive equation. 



The direct effects of molecular processes are generally insignificant for large-scale oceanic motions due to the small magnitude of the Ekman number and Reynolds number. However, these molecular processes are essential in the context of turbulence and ocean mixing. The Reynolds approach, which involves the averaging of the primitive equations, leads to the emergence of new variables at each level. This results in the so-called closure problem, necessitating the use of subgridscale (SGS) parameterization schemes to account for these subgrid scale effects.



Subgridscale parameterization schemes are used to model the effects of turbulence that are not resolved by the numerical model. These schemes can be broadly categorized based on their approach for lateral and vertical subgridscale closure. Filters and higher-order operators are often used to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary. Special dynamical parameterizations, such as topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion, and convection, are available for certain processes.



In the vertical direction, the surface mixed layer (SML) has historically received special attention due to its important role in air-sea exchange. The SML is the uppermost layer of the ocean where the properties of temperature and salinity are nearly uniform due to the effects of wind, waves, and convection. Turbulence in the SML is primarily driven by wind stress and buoyancy fluxes, leading to vertical mixing of heat, salt, and other properties.



The role of turbulence in ocean mixing is complex and multifaceted. It not only influences the distribution of heat, salt, and nutrients in the ocean, but also plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of oceanic eddies. Despite the significant advances in our understanding of turbulence and ocean mixing, many aspects of this process remain poorly understood due to the lack of high-resolution ocean observations and the inherent complexity of the oceanic turbulence. Therefore, further research in this area is essential for improving our understanding of the Earth's climate system.



#### 11.4d Turbulence and Climate Change



Turbulence in the Earth's oceans plays a significant role in the global climate system. It is a key factor in the transport of heat and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the ocean, which directly impacts the Earth's climate. 



The Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) is a prime example of how ocean turbulence can influence climate. The MOC is a system of surface and deep currents encompassing all ocean basins. It transports warm surface waters from the tropics to the poles and returns cold deep waters back to the tropics. Studies have shown that the strength of the MOC is highly correlated with changes in the meridional heat transport, with the circulation accounting for nearly 90% of the total heat transport (Johns et al., 2009). 



Climate change can, in turn, affect ocean turbulence. As the Earth's climate warms, the increased heat can intensify stratification in the ocean, which can suppress turbulence and reduce the efficiency of vertical mixing. This can lead to a decrease in the transport of nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface, affecting marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle.



Moreover, the representation of turbulence in climate models is a challenging task due to the complexity and small-scale nature of turbulent processes. Global Climate Models (GCMs) often use subgridscale (SGS) parameterization schemes to account for the effects of turbulence that are not resolved by the numerical model. However, these schemes are often based on simplifying assumptions and may not accurately represent the complex interactions between turbulence and larger-scale oceanic and atmospheric processes.



In conclusion, understanding the role of turbulence in the Earth's oceans is crucial for predicting future climate change and its impacts. Further research is needed to improve the representation of turbulence in climate models and to better understand the complex interactions between turbulence, ocean mixing, and climate change.

## Chapter: Chapter 12: Turbulence in Astrophysical Fluids



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex and chaotic phenomenon, is not confined to the realms of the ocean and atmosphere alone. It extends its reach far beyond, into the vast expanse of the cosmos, influencing the behavior of astrophysical fluids. This chapter, "Turbulence in Astrophysical Fluids," delves into the intricate dynamics of turbulence in the context of astrophysics.



Astrophysical fluids, which include interstellar medium, plasma around stars, and accretion disks around black holes, exhibit turbulent behavior. This turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as star formation, galaxy formation, and the propagation of cosmic rays. Understanding the nature of turbulence in these fluids is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the universe.



The study of turbulence in astrophysical fluids is a challenging endeavor due to the vast scales involved, both spatial and temporal, and the complex interplay of various physical processes. The turbulence in these fluids is often magnetohydrodynamic in nature, involving both fluid dynamics and electromagnetic fields. This adds another layer of complexity to the study of turbulence in astrophysical contexts.



In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles governing turbulence in astrophysical fluids, the mathematical models used to describe this turbulence, and the observational and computational techniques employed to study it. We will also discuss the implications of astrophysical turbulence for various cosmic phenomena.



As we embark on this journey through the cosmos, we will encounter turbulence in a new light, not as a mere disturbance, but as a key player in the grand cosmic drama. This exploration will not only deepen our understanding of turbulence but also illuminate the intricate workings of the universe.



### Section: 12.1 Turbulence in Stars



Stars, the celestial bodies that light up the universe, are not as serene as they appear. They are in fact, a hotbed of turbulent activity. The turbulence in stars plays a crucial role in their structure and evolution, influencing processes such as energy transport, mixing of stellar material, and stellar oscillations. In this section, we will delve into the nature of turbulence in stars and its implications for stellar structure and evolution.



#### Subsection: 12.1a Turbulence and Stellar Structure



The structure of a star is determined by the balance between the gravitational force pulling inward and the pressure force pushing outward. This balance, known as hydrostatic equilibrium, is maintained through the continuous transport of energy from the core to the surface of the star. Turbulence plays a key role in this energy transport process.



The energy generated in the core of a star through nuclear fusion is transported to the surface primarily through radiation and convection. In regions of the star where the temperature gradient is steep, convection becomes the dominant mode of energy transport. This convective motion gives rise to turbulence.



The convective turbulence in stars can be described using the mixing length theory, which is a simplified model of turbulence. According to this theory, a parcel of gas in a convective zone will rise or fall a certain distance, known as the mixing length, before its properties become indistinguishable from its surroundings. The mixing length is typically assumed to be a fraction of the pressure scale height of the star.



The mixing length theory, while useful, is a crude approximation of the complex turbulent processes occurring in stars. It does not account for the full range of turbulent scales, nor does it capture the intermittent and anisotropic nature of stellar turbulence. More sophisticated models of stellar turbulence, such as 3D simulations, are needed to accurately describe these processes.



The turbulence in stars also influences their luminosity. The luminosity of a star, denoted by "L", is given by the equation:



$$

L = \left ( \frac{R}{R_{sun}} \right )^2 \left ( \frac{T_{eff}}{T_{sun}} \right )^4

$$



where "R" is the radius of the star, "T<sub>eff</sub>" is the effective temperature of the star, and "R<sub>sun</sub>" and "T<sub>sun</sub>" are the radius and effective temperature of the sun, respectively. The effective temperature of a star is influenced by the turbulent energy transport within the star, and hence, turbulence indirectly affects the luminosity of the star.



Despite the progress made in understanding stellar turbulence, many challenges remain. The numerical treatment of turbulence is a particularly difficult challenge due to the wide range of scales involved and the complexity of the turbulent processes. However, ongoing research efforts are aimed at developing more accurate and comprehensive models of stellar turbulence, which will further our understanding of stars and their evolution.



#### Subsection: 12.1b Turbulence and Stellar Evolution



Stellar evolution is a complex process that is influenced by a myriad of factors, one of which is turbulence. Turbulence in stars can significantly affect their evolution by influencing the mixing of stellar material and the transport of energy.



The role of turbulence in stellar evolution can be illustrated by examining the case of R136a1, a star that is currently fusing hydrogen to helium predominantly by the CNO cycle due to the high temperatures at the core. Despite its Wolf–Rayet spectral appearance, R136a1 is a young star, just over a million years old. The emission spectrum of R136a1 is created by a dense stellar wind caused by the extreme luminosity, with the enhanced levels of helium and nitrogen being mixed from the core to the surface by strong convection. Over 90% of the star is convective, with a small non-convective layer at the surface.



The high degree of convection in R136a1 gives rise to significant turbulence, which plays a crucial role in the star's evolution. The turbulence facilitates the mixing of helium and nitrogen from the core to the surface, a process that is critical for the star's evolution. Furthermore, the turbulence also aids in the transport of energy from the core to the surface, helping to maintain the star's hydrostatic equilibrium.



Models of star formation by accretion from molecular clouds predict an upper limit to the mass a star can achieve before its radiation prevents further accretion. However, R136a1 clearly exceeds these limits, leading to the development of new single star accretion models potentially removing the upper limit, and the potential for massive star formation by stellar mergers. The properties of such a massive star are still uncertain, and the role of turbulence in its formation and evolution is an active area of research.



The numerical treatment of turbulence remains a significant challenge in the modeling of stellar evolution. Simplified models of turbulence, such as the mixing length theory, do not capture the full complexity of the turbulent processes occurring in stars. More sophisticated models, such as 3D simulations, are being developed to provide a more accurate description of turbulence in stars. These models will be crucial for improving our understanding of stellar evolution and for refining our predictions of the properties and behavior of stars like R136a1.



#### Subsection: 12.1c Turbulence and Stellar Oscillations



Stellar oscillations, or pulsations, are another area where turbulence plays a significant role. These oscillations are the result of instabilities in the balance of gravitational forces and internal pressure within the star. Turbulence can influence these oscillations, leading to complex and chaotic behavior.



The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of stellar pulsations have shown two distinct routes to chaotic behavior. The first is through a period doubling bifurcation, or cascade, leading to chaos. This is observed when plotting one maximum radius, or any other suitable variable, versus the next one in a "first return map". The near quadratic shape of the map is indicative of chaos and implies an underlying horseshoe map.



The second route to chaos is through the Pommeau–Manneville or "tangent bifurcation" route. This route is observed in other sequences of stellar models that differ by their average surface temperature $T$.



A visualization of the period doubling cascade to chaos for a sequence of stellar models can be represented by triplets of values of the stellar radius $(R_{i}, R_{i+1}, R_{i+2})$, where the indices $i$, $i+1$, $i+2$ indicate successive time intervals. This visualization provides a clear picture of the chaotic behavior induced by turbulence in stellar oscillations.



The role of turbulence in stellar oscillations is not just limited to inducing chaotic behavior. It also influences the energy transport within the star, affecting the star's luminosity $L$. The luminosity of a star can be expressed as $L = \left ( \frac{R}{R_{sun}} \right )^2 \left ( \frac{T_{eff}}{T_{sun}} \right )^4$, where $R$ is the star's radius and $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature. Turbulence can affect both the radius and the effective temperature of the star, thereby influencing its luminosity.



The study of turbulence in stellar oscillations is a complex and challenging field. It requires a deep understanding of fluid dynamics, stellar physics, and numerical methods. However, it is also a field that offers rich insights into the behavior of stars and the universe as a whole. Future research in this area promises to shed more light on the fascinating world of astrophysical fluids and their turbulent behavior.



#### Subsection: 12.1d Turbulence and Stellar Winds



Stellar winds, the continuous flow of charged particles from the surface of a star, are another domain where turbulence plays a significant role. These winds are driven by thermal pressure gradients and magnetic fields, and their behavior is significantly influenced by turbulence.



The turbulence in stellar winds can be modeled using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a method that combines the principles of fluid dynamics and electromagnetism. This approach allows us to understand the complex interplay between the charged particles, magnetic fields, and turbulent flows in stellar winds.



The MHD equations can be used to model the turbulent behavior of stellar winds. These equations describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in a magnetized fluid. The turbulence in stellar winds can lead to a variety of phenomena, including the generation of magnetic fields, the acceleration of particles, and the heating of the stellar wind.



The turbulence in stellar winds can also influence the mass-loss rate of a star. The mass-loss rate, denoted by $\dot{M}$, is a measure of the amount of mass a star loses over time due to stellar winds. The mass-loss rate can be expressed as $\dot{M} = 4\pi r^2 \rho v$, where $r$ is the radius of the star, $\rho$ is the density of the stellar wind, and $v$ is the velocity of the wind. Turbulence can affect both the density and the velocity of the stellar wind, thereby influencing the mass-loss rate.



The study of turbulence in stellar winds is a complex and challenging field. It requires a deep understanding of fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and astrophysics. However, it is a crucial area of research, as it can provide insights into the evolution of stars and the dynamics of the interstellar medium.



In the next section, we will explore the role of turbulence in the formation and evolution of galaxies. We will discuss how turbulence can influence the dynamics of the interstellar medium, the formation of stars, and the structure of galaxies.



#### Subsection: 12.2a Turbulence and Galaxy Formation



Turbulence plays a significant role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. The interstellar medium (ISM), the matter that exists in the space between the stars in a galaxy, is a turbulent fluid. This turbulence can influence the dynamics of the ISM and the process of galaxy formation.



The ISM is composed of gas (primarily hydrogen) and dust, and it is in this medium that new stars are born. The turbulence in the ISM can affect the process of star formation in several ways. For instance, it can compress the gas in the ISM, triggering the collapse of the gas into a star. On the other hand, turbulence can also disrupt the process of star formation by dispersing the gas and preventing it from collapsing.



The turbulence in the ISM can be modeled using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), similar to the approach used for modeling turbulence in stellar winds. The MHD equations describe the behavior of the gas and the magnetic fields in the ISM, taking into account the effects of turbulence.



The turbulence in the ISM can also influence the morphology of a galaxy. As mentioned in the context, galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. The turbulence in the ISM can affect the shape and structure of a galaxy, leading to the formation of different types of galaxies.



For example, in spiral galaxies, the rotation of the galaxy can generate turbulence in the ISM. This turbulence can lead to the formation of spiral arms, the distinctive features of spiral galaxies. The spiral arms are regions of higher density in the ISM, where star formation is more likely to occur.



In elliptical galaxies, the turbulence in the ISM can be influenced by the motion of the stars. The stars in elliptical galaxies are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions, which can generate turbulence in the ISM. This turbulence can affect the distribution of gas and dust in the galaxy, influencing the rate of star formation and the evolution of the galaxy.



In the next subsection, we will explore the role of turbulence in the dynamics of galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe. We will discuss how turbulence can influence the behavior of galaxies within a cluster and the evolution of the cluster as a whole.



#### Subsection: 12.2b Turbulence and Galaxy Evolution



Turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) not only influences the formation of galaxies but also their evolution. The evolution of galaxies is a complex process that involves the interaction of various physical phenomena, including star formation, stellar evolution, and the dynamics of the ISM. Turbulence in the ISM can affect all these processes, thereby influencing the evolution of galaxies.



One of the ways turbulence can affect galaxy evolution is through its impact on star formation. As discussed in the previous section, turbulence can trigger the collapse of gas in the ISM, leading to star formation. However, the process of star formation can also generate turbulence in the ISM. For instance, when a massive star forms, it can produce strong stellar winds and supernova explosions, which can generate turbulence in the surrounding ISM. This feedback process can regulate the rate of star formation in a galaxy, influencing its evolution.



Turbulence can also affect the distribution of gas and dust in a galaxy. For example, in the case of the Messier 81 galaxy, turbulence in the ISM can cause the gas and dust to be distributed unevenly, leading to the formation of spiral arms and other structures. This can affect the morphology of the galaxy, influencing its evolution.



Furthermore, turbulence can play a role in the interaction between galaxies. For instance, in the case of Stephan's Quintet, a group of five galaxies, the collision between the galaxies can generate a shock wave that produces turbulence in the ISM. This turbulence can trigger star formation and other processes, influencing the evolution of the galaxies in the group.



In summary, turbulence in the ISM can influence the evolution of galaxies in various ways. It can affect the rate of star formation, the distribution of gas and dust, and the interaction between galaxies. Understanding the role of turbulence in galaxy evolution is therefore crucial for understanding the history and future of galaxies. Future research in this area will likely involve the use of advanced numerical simulations and observations from telescopes such as the NASA Chandra X-ray Observatory and the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope.



#### Subsection: 12.2c Turbulence and Galactic Winds



Galactic winds, which are streams of high-speed charged particles ejected from galaxies, are another important aspect of turbulence in astrophysical fluids. These winds can have a significant impact on the interstellar medium (ISM), influencing the evolution of galaxies and the formation of stars.



Galactic winds are primarily driven by stellar processes such as supernova explosions and stellar winds from massive stars. These processes can inject a large amount of energy and momentum into the ISM, generating turbulence. The turbulence, in turn, can affect the propagation and structure of the galactic winds.



For instance, in the case of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, the galactic winds are known to be highly turbulent. This turbulence can affect the distribution of gas and dust in the galaxy, influencing the formation of stars and the evolution of the galaxy.



Moreover, the turbulence in galactic winds can also influence the interaction between galaxies. For example, in the case of Messier 82, also known as the Cigar Galaxy, the turbulent galactic winds can interact with the ISM of nearby galaxies, triggering star formation and other processes.



The study of turbulence in galactic winds is not only important for understanding the evolution of galaxies but also for understanding the larger-scale structure of the universe. For instance, the turbulence in galactic winds can influence the distribution of galaxies in the universe, affecting the formation of galaxy clusters and superclusters.



In summary, turbulence in galactic winds plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies and the structure of the universe. Understanding this turbulence is therefore a key aspect of astrophysical fluid dynamics. Future studies using advanced telescopes and numerical simulations will provide further insights into this fascinating topic.



#### Subsection: 12.2d Turbulence and the Interstellar Medium



The interstellar medium (ISM) is the matter that fills the space between the stars in a galaxy. This matter is primarily composed of hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, and is characterized by a complex, turbulent structure. The turbulence in the ISM plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies and the formation of stars.



The ISM is not uniform but is divided into different phases, each with distinct properties. The three-phase model of the ISM, proposed by Field, Goldsmith, and Habing in 1969, and later refined by McKee and Ostriker in 1977, provides a useful framework for understanding the turbulence in the ISM. This model includes a cold dense phase with a temperature less than 300 K, a warm intercloud phase with a temperature around $10^4$ K, and a hot phase with a temperature around $10^6$ K.



The different phases of the ISM are roughly in pressure balance over most of the Galactic disk. This is because regions of excess pressure will expand and cool, while under-pressure regions will be compressed and heated. Therefore, since $P = n k T$, where $P$ is pressure, $n$ is particle number density, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is temperature, hot regions (high $T$) generally have low particle number density $n$.



The turbulence in the ISM can be influenced by various factors, including galactic winds, supernova explosions, and stellar winds. These processes can inject energy and momentum into the ISM, generating turbulence. The turbulence, in turn, can affect the distribution of gas and dust in the galaxy, influencing the formation of stars and the evolution of the galaxy.



Moreover, the turbulence in the ISM can also influence the interaction between galaxies. For instance, the turbulent ISM can interact with the galactic winds of nearby galaxies, triggering star formation and other processes.



In summary, turbulence in the ISM plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies and the structure of the universe. Understanding this turbulence is therefore a key aspect of astrophysical fluid dynamics. Future studies using advanced telescopes and numerical simulations will provide further insights into this fascinating topic.



#### Subsection: 12.3a Turbulence and the Solar Wind Structure



The solar wind, a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, is a significant contributor to turbulence in astrophysical fluids. This wind is not uniform but exists in two fundamental states: the slow solar wind and the fast solar wind. The differences between these two states extend beyond their speeds and have significant implications for the turbulence they generate.



The slow solar wind has a velocity of approximately 300 km/s, a temperature of around 100 MK, and a composition closely matching the corona of the Sun (Fox, 2012). On the other hand, the fast solar wind has a higher velocity and a different composition. The interaction between these two states of solar wind and their interaction with the interplanetary magnetic field can lead to turbulence.



Turbulence in the solar wind can be influenced by fluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field (Cuperman & Metzler, 1973). These fluctuations can affect the heat conduction in the solar wind, leading to changes in the wind's speed and temperature. This, in turn, can influence the structure of the solar wind and the turbulence within it.



Moreover, the solar wind's turbulence can also be affected by the relative magnitude of streaming velocities of alpha particles and protons (Cuperman & Metzler, 1976). Changes in these velocities can lead to changes in the solar wind's structure and the turbulence within it.



The turbulence in the solar wind can have significant effects on the solar system. For instance, it can affect the propagation of cosmic rays, the dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere, and the behavior of comets in the solar system. Therefore, understanding the turbulence in the solar wind is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the solar system and beyond.



In summary, the solar wind's structure and its interaction with the interplanetary magnetic field play a crucial role in generating turbulence in astrophysical fluids. This turbulence, in turn, can influence various processes in the solar system and the broader universe.



#### Subsection: 12.3b Turbulence and Solar Wind Evolution



The evolution of solar wind turbulence is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors. One of the key factors is the solar radio emission, which can significantly influence the solar wind's turbulence.



Solar radio emissions, such as Type V bursts, are continuum emissions that last from one to a few minutes immediately after a group of Type III bursts, generally occurring below around 120 MHz. These bursts are thought to be caused by harmonic plasma emission associated with the same streams of electrons responsible for the associated Type III bursts (Fox, 2012). The persistence of Type V bursts, driven by a slower and less-collimated electron population, leads to broader-band emission and a reversal in the circular polarization sign from that of the associated Type III bursts. This can contribute to the turbulence in the solar wind.



In addition to Type V bursts, there are other types of solar radio bursts that can influence the turbulence in the solar wind. For instance, Types J and U bursts, which are Type III bursts where the frequency drift reverses to go from lower to higher frequencies, suggest that an electron beam first traveled away and then back toward the Sun along a closed magnetic field trajectory. This can lead to changes in the solar wind's structure and the turbulence within it.



Moreover, high-frequency microwave burst types, such as microwave Type IV bursts, impulsive bursts, postbursts, and spike bursts, can also contribute to the turbulence in the solar wind. These bursts can cause fluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field, leading to changes in the solar wind's speed and temperature, and thus influencing the turbulence within it.



Understanding the role of solar radio emissions in the evolution of solar wind turbulence is crucial for predicting the behavior of the solar wind and its effects on the solar system. For instance, changes in the solar wind's turbulence can affect the propagation of cosmic rays, the dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere, and the behavior of comets in the solar system.



In conclusion, the evolution of turbulence in the solar wind is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors, including solar radio emissions. Further research is needed to fully understand these interactions and their implications for the solar system and beyond.



#### Subsection: 12.3c Turbulence and Solar Wind Heating



The heating of the solar wind is a phenomenon that has been extensively studied, and turbulence plays a significant role in this process. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, is known to be heated and accelerated as it travels away from the Sun. This heating is not uniform, but rather fluctuates, leading to turbulence within the solar wind (Cuperman and Metzler, 1973).



The turbulence in the solar wind can be attributed to the fluctuations in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). These fluctuations can cause changes in the solar wind's speed and temperature, leading to turbulence within it (Cuperman and Metzler, 1973). The IMF is carried with the solar wind from the Sun, and its fluctuations can be caused by various factors, including solar radio emissions and solar flares.



Solar flares, such as the M5.3-class solar flare that erupted from Sunspot 1283 in September, can cause significant disturbances in the IMF and subsequently the solar wind. These disturbances can lead to an increase in the solar wind's speed and temperature, contributing to the turbulence within it (Fox, 2012).



Furthermore, the heating of the solar wind can also be influenced by the solar cycle. The solar cycle, which is the periodic change in the Sun's activity and appearance, can affect the solar wind's properties, including its speed, density, and temperature. For instance, during solar maximum, when the Sun's activity is at its peak, the solar wind's speed and temperature can increase, leading to increased turbulence within it.



The study of turbulence in the solar wind and its role in heating is crucial for understanding the behavior of the solar wind and its effects on the solar system. It can provide insights into the processes that drive the solar wind and the mechanisms that contribute to its heating and acceleration. Moreover, it can also help in predicting the behavior of the solar wind and its potential impacts on Earth's magnetosphere and space weather. 



In conclusion, turbulence in the solar wind, driven by fluctuations in the IMF and influenced by solar radio emissions and the solar cycle, plays a significant role in the heating of the solar wind. Further studies are needed to fully understand the complex processes involved in this phenomenon and their implications for the solar system.



#### Subsection: 12.3d Turbulence and Solar Wind Acceleration



The acceleration of the solar wind is another aspect of solar wind dynamics that is significantly influenced by turbulence. The solar wind is not only heated as it travels away from the Sun, but it is also accelerated. This acceleration is not a constant process, but rather, it fluctuates, leading to turbulence within the solar wind (Cuperman and Metzler, 1973).



The acceleration of the solar wind can be attributed to several factors, including the pressure gradient force, the centrifugal force, and the magnetic tension force. However, the role of turbulence in this process is particularly significant. Turbulence can enhance the acceleration of the solar wind by transferring energy from the larger scales to the smaller scales, where it can be converted into kinetic energy, leading to an increase in the solar wind's speed (Metzler and Dryer, 1978).



The turbulence in the solar wind can also influence the streaming velocities of different particles within it. For instance, the relative magnitude of streaming velocities of alpha particles and protons at 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) can be affected by turbulence (Cuperman and Metzler, 1976). This can have significant implications for the dynamics of the solar wind and its interaction with the interplanetary medium.



Moreover, the acceleration of the solar wind can also be influenced by the solar cycle. During solar maximum, when the Sun's activity is at its peak, the acceleration of the solar wind can increase, leading to increased turbulence within it. This can result in a more dynamic and complex solar wind structure, with implications for space weather and the solar system's magnetosphere (Fox, 2012).



The study of turbulence in the solar wind and its role in acceleration is crucial for understanding the behavior of the solar wind and its effects on the solar system. It can provide insights into the processes that drive the solar wind and the mechanisms that contribute to its acceleration. Furthermore, it can also help in predicting the behavior of the solar wind and its potential impacts on the Earth's magnetosphere and space weather.



In conclusion, turbulence plays a significant role in the dynamics of the solar wind, influencing both its heating and acceleration. Understanding these processes is crucial for our understanding of the solar wind and its effects on the solar system. Future research in this area will undoubtedly continue to shed light on these complex and fascinating phenomena.



#### Subsection: 12.4a Turbulence and Accretion Disk Structure



The structure of accretion disks is significantly influenced by turbulence. The α-Disk model proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973) suggests that turbulence in the gas is the source of an increased viscosity. The disk viscosity can be estimated as $\nu = \alpha c_{\rm s}H$ where $c_{\rm s}$ is the sound speed, $H$ is the scale height of the disk, and $\alpha$ is a free parameter between zero (no accretion) and approximately one.



In a turbulent medium, $\nu\approx v_{\rm turb} l_{\rm turb}$, where $v_{\rm turb}$ is the velocity of turbulent cells relative to the mean gas motion, and $l_{\rm turb}$ is the size of the largest turbulent cells. The size of the largest turbulent cells is estimated as $l_{\rm turb} \approx H = c_{\rm s}/\Omega$ and $v_{\rm turb} \approx c_{\rm s}$, where $\Omega = (G M)^{1/2} r^{-3/2}$ is the Keplerian orbital angular velocity, $r$ is the radial distance from the central object of mass $M$.



By using the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, combined with conservation of angular momentum and assuming that the disk is thin, the equations of disk structure may be solved in terms of the $\alpha$ parameter. Many of the observables depend only weakly on $\alpha$, so this theory is predictive even though it has a free parameter.



The turbulence in accretion disks can also influence the accretion rate, which is represented by $\dot{M}_{16}$ in units of $10^{16}{\rm g\ s}^{-1}$. The mass of the central accreting object in units of a solar mass, $M_\bigodot$, is represented by $m_1$. The radius of a point in the disk, in units of $10^{10}{\rm cm}$, is represented by $R_{10}$. The function $f = \left[1-\left(\frac{R_\star}{R}\right)^{1/2} \right]^{1/4}$, where $R_\star$ is the radius where angular momentum is transferred, also plays a significant role in the structure of the accretion disk.



The study of turbulence in accretion disks is crucial for understanding the behavior of astrophysical fluids and their effects on the structure and dynamics of the universe. It can provide insights into the processes that drive the formation and evolution of celestial bodies and the mechanisms that govern their behavior.



#### Subsection: 12.4b Turbulence and Accretion Disk Evolution



The evolution of accretion disks is closely tied to the turbulence within them. As we have seen, turbulence plays a crucial role in the structure of the disk, influencing the viscosity and the accretion rate. However, it also has significant implications for the disk's evolution over time.



The α-Disk model, as proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973), provides a framework for understanding how turbulence contributes to the evolution of accretion disks. The model suggests that the disk's viscosity, represented by $\nu$, is a function of the sound speed $c_{\rm s}$, the scale height of the disk $H$, and the parameter $\alpha$. This viscosity, in turn, determines the rate at which matter is accreted onto the central object.



The turbulence in the disk can cause fluctuations in the accretion rate, represented by $\dot{M}_{16}$, which can lead to changes in the disk's structure over time. For instance, an increase in the accretion rate can cause the disk to expand, while a decrease can cause it to contract. These changes can have significant effects on the observable properties of the disk, such as its luminosity and temperature.



Furthermore, the turbulence can also lead to the transport of angular momentum within the disk. This transport is crucial for the evolution of the disk, as it allows matter to move inward and be accreted onto the central object. The rate of angular momentum transport is determined by the parameter $\alpha$, which is a measure of the strength of the turbulence.



In conclusion, the study of turbulence in accretion disks is not only crucial for understanding their structure but also their evolution. The α-Disk model provides a valuable tool for studying these processes, although it is important to note that it is a simplified model and may not capture all the complexities of real accretion disks. Future research will undoubtedly continue to refine our understanding of these fascinating astrophysical objects.



#### Subsection: 12.4c Turbulence and Accretion Disk Heating



Turbulence in accretion disks not only influences their structure and evolution but also plays a significant role in their heating mechanisms. The α-Disk model, as proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973), provides a framework for understanding how turbulence contributes to the heating of accretion disks.



The turbulence in the disk, represented by the velocity of turbulent cells relative to the mean gas motion $v_{\rm turb}$ and the size of the largest turbulent cells $l_{\rm turb}$, can generate heat through viscous dissipation. This heat, in turn, contributes to the disk's mid-plane temperature $T_c$.



The heating of the disk can be understood in terms of the α-Disk model. The model suggests that the disk's viscosity $\nu$ is a function of the sound speed $c_{\rm s}$, the scale height of the disk $H$, and the parameter $\alpha$. This viscosity, in turn, determines the rate at which heat is generated through viscous dissipation.



The heat generated by the turbulence can have significant effects on the observable properties of the disk. For instance, an increase in the disk's temperature can lead to an increase in its luminosity, as the disk radiates away the heat. Furthermore, the heat can also influence the disk's structure, as it can cause the disk to expand.



The turbulence can also lead to fluctuations in the disk's temperature. These fluctuations can be caused by changes in the turbulence itself, such as changes in the strength of the turbulence or the size of the turbulent cells. These fluctuations can have significant effects on the observable properties of the disk, such as its luminosity and temperature.



In conclusion, the study of turbulence in accretion disks is crucial for understanding not only their structure and evolution but also their heating mechanisms. The α-Disk model provides a valuable tool for studying these processes, although it is important to note that it is a simplified model and may not capture all the complexities of real accretion disks. Future research will undoubtedly continue to refine our understanding of these fascinating astronomical objects.



#### Subsection: 12.4d Turbulence and Accretion Disk Emission



Turbulence in accretion disks not only influences their structure, evolution, and heating mechanisms, but it also plays a crucial role in their emission properties. The α-Disk model, as proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973), provides a framework for understanding how turbulence contributes to the emission of accretion disks.



The turbulence in the disk, represented by the velocity of turbulent cells relative to the mean gas motion $v_{\rm turb}$ and the size of the largest turbulent cells $l_{\rm turb}$, can generate heat through viscous dissipation. This heat, in turn, contributes to the disk's mid-plane temperature $T_c$. The temperature of the disk is a key factor in determining the disk's emission properties, as it influences the disk's blackbody radiation.



The α-Disk model suggests that the disk's viscosity $\nu$ is a function of the sound speed $c_{\rm s}$, the scale height of the disk $H$, and the parameter $\alpha$. This viscosity, in turn, determines the rate at which heat is generated through viscous dissipation, and thus the disk's temperature. The temperature of the disk, in turn, influences the disk's emission spectrum.



The turbulence can also lead to fluctuations in the disk's temperature. These fluctuations can be caused by changes in the turbulence itself, such as changes in the strength of the turbulence or the size of the turbulent cells. These fluctuations can have significant effects on the observable properties of the disk, such as its emission spectrum.



In conclusion, the study of turbulence in accretion disks is crucial for understanding not only their structure and evolution but also their emission properties. The α-Disk model provides a valuable tool for studying these processes, although it is important to note that it is a simplified model and may not capture all the complexities of real accretion disks. Future research should aim to refine this model and develop more sophisticated models that can capture the full range of behaviors observed in accretion disks.

## Chapter: Chapter 13: Turbululence in Engineering Applications:



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex phenomenon that occurs in both the ocean and the atmosphere, has significant implications in the field of engineering. This chapter, "Turbulence in Engineering Applications," aims to delve into the intricate relationship between turbulence and its practical applications in engineering.



Turbulence, characterized by chaotic and irregular fluid flow, is a fundamental aspect of many engineering disciplines. From the design of aircraft and ships to the development of weather prediction models and renewable energy systems, understanding turbulence is crucial. Despite its complexity, engineers have developed various methods and models to predict and manage the effects of turbulence, enhancing the efficiency and safety of numerous engineering systems.



In this chapter, we will explore the role of turbulence in different engineering fields, the challenges it presents, and the innovative solutions engineers have devised to overcome these challenges. We will discuss the mathematical models used to predict turbulence, such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, and how these models are applied in real-world scenarios.



We will also delve into the impact of turbulence on the design and operation of various engineering systems, including aircraft, ships, wind turbines, and HVAC systems. Furthermore, we will examine how engineers use turbulence to their advantage in certain applications, such as enhancing mixing in chemical reactors or increasing heat transfer in heat exchangers.



This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the role of turbulence in engineering, highlighting its challenges and opportunities. By understanding turbulence and its effects, engineers can design and operate systems that are more efficient, safe, and sustainable.



### Section: 13.1 Turbulence in Aerodynamics:



Turbulence plays a significant role in the field of aerodynamics, particularly in the design and operation of aircraft. The understanding and management of turbulence are crucial for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and performance of aircraft.



#### Subsection 13.1a Turbulence and Aircraft Design



The design of an aircraft is heavily influenced by the need to manage and mitigate the effects of turbulence. The shape and structure of an aircraft, from its wings to its fuselage, are designed to withstand turbulent airflows and minimize their impact on the aircraft's performance.



For instance, the Hispano-Suiza 12N, a variant of the Hispano Suiza in Aeronautics, is an example of an aircraft designed with turbulence in mind. The aircraft's structure and materials are chosen to withstand turbulent conditions while maintaining optimal performance.



Similarly, the Micromechanical Flying Insect (MFI), a micro-air vehicle, is designed to handle turbulence at a much smaller scale. The MFI's structure, made of lightweight materials like honey-comb carbon fiber beams and silicon joints, is designed to handle the turbulent airflows encountered in its operational environment. The MFI's functionality is broken up into smaller components that work together to sustain a stable flight pattern, even in turbulent conditions.



The design of these components, from the visual system that analyzes the location in three-dimensional space to the inertial system that distributes specific functions to the wings, is influenced by the need to manage turbulence. The wings, equipped with a number of sensors, deliver accurate wing thrusts to fulfill the action, even in the presence of turbulence.



The design of aircraft, whether large like the Hispano-Suiza 12N or small like the MFI, illustrates the importance of understanding and managing turbulence in aerodynamics. By designing aircraft to withstand and mitigate the effects of turbulence, engineers can enhance the safety and performance of these vehicles.



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models used to predict turbulence, such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, and how these models are applied in the design and operation of aircraft. We will also explore the challenges and opportunities presented by turbulence in aerodynamics, and how engineers are innovating to overcome these challenges and harness the power of turbulence.



#### Subsection 13.1b Turbulence and Aircraft Performance



The performance of an aircraft is significantly affected by turbulence. Turbulence can cause changes in the aircraft's altitude, speed, and direction, which can lead to discomfort for passengers and crew, increased fuel consumption, and even structural damage to the aircraft in extreme cases.



One of the key performance parameters affected by turbulence is the aircraft's stability and control. The United States Air Force Stability and Control Digital DATCOM (Data Compendium) is a comprehensive tool used to analyze the stability and control characteristics of aircraft in various flight conditions, including turbulence. The DATCOM provides engineers with a wealth of data that can be used to optimize the design of an aircraft for improved performance in turbulent conditions.



The performance-based navigation (PBN) system is another example of an engineering application that is significantly affected by turbulence. The PBN system relies on on-board performance monitoring and alerting to ensure accurate navigation. However, turbulence can cause deviations from the planned flight path, which can lead to increased fuel consumption and flight time. Future developments in PBN systems aim to improve the accuracy of navigation in the vertical plane, which is particularly susceptible to turbulence.



The impact of turbulence on aircraft performance is also evident in the development of collaborative combat aircraft (CCAs). These aircraft are designed to operate in turbulent conditions, with features such as advanced aerodynamics and control systems to mitigate the effects of turbulence. For example, the Hispano-Suiza 12M, a variant of the Hispano Suiza in Aeronautics, is designed with a robust structure and materials to withstand turbulent conditions while maintaining optimal performance.



In conclusion, turbulence has a significant impact on the performance of aircraft, affecting everything from stability and control to fuel consumption and flight time. Engineers must therefore consider turbulence in the design and operation of aircraft, using tools such as the DATCOM and PBN systems to optimize performance in turbulent conditions. Future developments in these areas, such as improved navigation in the vertical plane and the development of CCAs, promise to further enhance the performance of aircraft in turbulence.



#### Subsection 13.1c Turbulence and Aircraft Safety



Turbulence is not only a factor that affects the performance of an aircraft but also a significant concern for aircraft safety. The safety of an aircraft during flight is contingent on the ability of the aircraft to withstand and navigate through turbulent conditions. 



One of the most critical safety concerns related to turbulence is the potential for aircraft stalls. A stall occurs when the airflow over the wing is disrupted, causing a loss of lift. This can occur when the aircraft is flying at a high angle of attack, such as during takeoff or landing, or when the aircraft encounters severe turbulence. For example, during the British European Airways Flight 548, the leading-edge devices were retracted at a speed below the safe droop flap retraction speed, leading to a stall warning. The aircraft's nose was held up, keeping the angle of attack high and further approaching a stall. This incident underscores the importance of understanding and mitigating the effects of turbulence on aircraft safety.



Aircraft are equipped with various systems to detect and warn of potential stalls. These systems include visual and audible warnings, as well as physical feedback mechanisms such as a stick shake or a stick push. These systems are designed to alert the pilot to the impending stall and provide them with the opportunity to take corrective action.



In addition to stall warnings, aircraft are also equipped with systems to manage turbulence. For instance, modern aircraft are equipped with autopilot systems that can automatically adjust the aircraft's flight path to minimize the effects of turbulence. However, these systems can be disrupted by severe turbulence, as was the case in the British European Airways Flight 548, where the stick push disconnected the autopilot.



The safety of aircraft in turbulent conditions is also a significant consideration in aircraft design. For example, the Hispano-Suiza 12N, a variant of the Hispano Suiza in Aeronautics, is designed with a robust structure and materials to withstand turbulent conditions. Similarly, collaborative combat aircraft (CCAs) are designed with advanced aerodynamics and control systems to mitigate the effects of turbulence.



In conclusion, turbulence is a significant factor in aircraft safety, affecting everything from stall warnings to autopilot systems. Understanding and mitigating the effects of turbulence is therefore a critical aspect of aircraft design and operation. Future developments in aircraft design and technology aim to further improve the safety of aircraft in turbulent conditions.



#### Subsection 13.1d Turbulence and Aircraft Noise



Turbulence, while primarily considered for its impact on aircraft safety and performance, also plays a significant role in the generation of aircraft noise. This noise, produced by the interaction of turbulent airflow with the aircraft structure, can be a significant issue for both the comfort of passengers and crew, and for the communities overflown by aircraft.



Aircraft noise is a complex phenomenon, resulting from a combination of sources including the engines, airframe, and the interaction of the aircraft with the atmosphere. Turbulence contributes to this noise in several ways. Firstly, turbulence in the airflow over the aircraft's wings and fuselage can cause vibrations that radiate as sound. This is known as airframe noise. Secondly, turbulence in the exhaust jet of the aircraft's engines can also generate noise. This is known as jet noise.



The Hispano-Suiza 12N, a variant of the Hispano-Suiza 12Y series, is an example of an aircraft engine where turbulence-induced noise is a significant factor. The engine's exhaust jet is highly turbulent, and this turbulence contributes to the overall noise output of the engine. Efforts to reduce this noise have focused on reducing the turbulence in the exhaust jet, for example through the use of chevrons or other turbulence-reducing devices.



In addition to the noise generated by the aircraft itself, turbulence in the atmosphere can also contribute to the noise experienced by those on the ground. This is because turbulence can cause sound waves to scatter, increasing the area over which the noise is heard. This effect can be particularly significant in the vicinity of airports, where aircraft are flying at low altitudes.



The impact of turbulence on aircraft noise is a significant area of research, with ongoing efforts to develop methods to reduce turbulence-induced noise. These efforts include the development of new aircraft designs, improvements to engine technology, and the implementation of operational procedures to minimize the impact of turbulence on aircraft noise.



In the context of engineering applications, understanding the relationship between turbulence and aircraft noise is crucial. It allows for the development of more efficient and quieter aircraft, improving the overall quality of air travel and reducing the environmental impact of aviation.



#### Subsection 13.2a Turbulence and Ship Design



Turbulence plays a crucial role in the design and operation of ships, affecting their speed, stability, and fuel efficiency. Understanding and managing turbulence is therefore a key aspect of naval architecture and marine engineering.



One of the primary ways in which turbulence affects ships is through its impact on hull resistance. When a ship moves through water, it creates a boundary layer of fluid that clings to the hull. Within this layer, the fluid velocity changes from zero at the hull surface to the ship's speed at the outer edge. This velocity gradient creates shear stress, which in turn generates turbulence. The turbulent flow increases the drag on the ship, reducing its speed and increasing its fuel consumption.



The design of the ship's hull can significantly influence the extent of this turbulence. For instance, the Project 22160 patrol ship, designed by C. Raymond Hunt Associates, features a hull shape that is optimized to reduce turbulence. The ship's length, beam, and draft are carefully balanced to minimize the velocity gradient in the boundary layer, thereby reducing the generation of turbulence.



The ship's propulsion system also plays a role in managing turbulence. The Project 22160 patrol ship is propelled by four Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving a 3-bladed screw propeller. The design and arrangement of these propellers can influence the turbulence in the ship's wake, affecting both the ship's performance and the sea conditions for following vessels.



In addition to the hull and propulsion system, the ship's appendages, such as rudders and stabilizers, can also generate turbulence. These appendages are necessary for controlling the ship's movement, but their interaction with the water flow can create additional turbulence. Designers must therefore find a balance between control and efficiency when designing these components.



Turbulence also affects the ship's seakeeping qualities, or its behavior in waves. A ship with good seakeeping qualities is stable and comfortable for its crew and passengers, even in rough seas. The Project 22160 patrol ship, for example, is described as having been a good sea boat with gentle motion, despite the turbulence generated by its movement through the water.



In conclusion, turbulence is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that significantly impacts the design and operation of ships. Understanding and managing this turbulence is a key challenge in naval architecture and marine engineering, requiring a careful balance of various design factors. Ongoing research in this field aims to develop new design methods and technologies to better manage turbulence, with the goal of creating ships that are faster, more efficient, and more comfortable to sail.



#### Subsection 13.2b Turbulence and Ship Performance



The performance of a ship is significantly influenced by the turbulence generated in its operation. This turbulence can affect various aspects of the ship's performance, including its speed, maneuverability, and fuel efficiency.



One of the key performance parameters of a ship is its speed. As discussed in the previous section, turbulence increases the drag on the ship, thereby reducing its speed. For instance, the E-Ship 1, a wind-powered cargo ship developed by Enercon, has been designed to minimize turbulence. The ship features four large, rotating cylinders that use the Magnus effect to generate forward thrust. By reducing turbulence, this design allows the ship to maintain a high speed even in adverse weather conditions.



Turbulence also affects the maneuverability of a ship. When a ship turns, the flow of water around the hull becomes asymmetric, leading to the generation of additional turbulence. This turbulence can make the ship harder to control, particularly in rough seas. The design of the ship's hull and appendages can help manage this turbulence. For example, the Tennessee-class cruiser, despite having reduced thicknesses in belt and deck armor compared to the Pennsylvania class, carried 30 percent more weight in armor and related protective systems. This increase was due in large part to increased armor on the main turrets and redoubts, which were larger due to the increase in main gun caliber, and an increased area of side armor coverage. This design helped manage the turbulence generated during maneuvers, thereby improving the ship's maneuverability.



Fuel efficiency is another important performance parameter that is affected by turbulence. As mentioned earlier, turbulence increases the drag on the ship, which in turn increases its fuel consumption. The design of the ship's propulsion system can help mitigate this effect. For instance, gas turbines, such as those used in the Project 22160 patrol ship, operate at extremely high RPM and exhibit narrow powerbands. This design helps manage the turbulence in the ship's wake, thereby improving its fuel efficiency.



In conclusion, turbulence plays a significant role in determining the performance of a ship. By understanding and managing turbulence, naval architects and marine engineers can design ships that are faster, more maneuverable, and more fuel-efficient.



#### 13.2c Turbulence and Ship Safety



Turbulence not only affects the performance of a ship but also its safety. The safety of a ship is paramount, and understanding the effects of turbulence on ship safety can help in designing safer ships and implementing better navigational practices.



One of the key safety concerns related to turbulence is the stability of the ship. Turbulence can cause a ship to roll, pitch, or yaw, which can be dangerous, especially in rough seas. The design of the ship's hull and the distribution of its weight can help manage this turbulence and maintain the stability of the ship. For instance, the Project 22160 patrol ship, despite its large size, has been designed to be stable even in turbulent conditions. This is achieved through a combination of a well-designed hull and a sophisticated stabilization system.



Another safety concern related to turbulence is the risk of collision. The navigation paradox, as described by Robert E. Machol and Peter G. Reich, suggests that increased navigational precision can actually increase the risk of collision. This is because ships and aircraft can now follow navigational paths with such precision that, without better distribution of routes and collision avoidance procedures, the likelihood of two craft occupying the same space has increased. This is particularly relevant in the context of turbulence, as it can cause a ship to deviate from its intended path, thereby increasing the risk of collision.



Research by Russ Paielli has shown that aircraft cruising at random altitudes have fewer collisions than those obeying discrete cruising altitude rules. While this research was conducted in the context of aircraft, it has implications for ship safety as well. Ships that are able to adjust their cruising depth in response to turbulence may be able to reduce the risk of collision.



In conclusion, turbulence has significant implications for ship safety. Understanding these implications can help in designing safer ships and implementing better navigational practices. Future research in this area should focus on developing more sophisticated turbulence management systems and improving collision avoidance procedures.



#### 13.2d Turbulence and Ship Noise



Turbulence in the ocean can significantly contribute to the noise generated by a ship, affecting both its operational efficiency and detectability. This noise, often referred to as the ship's acoustic signature, can be influenced by various factors, including the ship's design, the machinery onboard, and the hydrodynamic interactions between the ship and the water.



The noise generated by a ship can be broadly classified into two categories: machinery noise and hydrodynamic noise. Machinery noise is primarily caused by the ship's engines, generators, and other mechanical systems. Hydrodynamic noise, on the other hand, is caused by the interaction of the ship's hull with the water, particularly in turbulent conditions.



Hydrodynamic noise is often more challenging to control as it is directly influenced by the turbulent flow of water around the ship's hull. This turbulence can cause pressure fluctuations on the hull surface, which in turn generate noise. The noise generated by turbulence can be particularly problematic for military vessels, as it can increase their detectability by sonar systems.



To control the noise generated by turbulence, naval architects employ various strategies at the design stage. These include optimizing the ship's hull shape to reduce turbulence, using materials that can absorb noise, and implementing advanced vibration control systems. For instance, the Project 22160 patrol ship has been designed with a hull shape that minimizes turbulence, thereby reducing the ship's noise signature.



In addition to these design strategies, operational measures can also be used to control the noise generated by turbulence. These include adjusting the ship's speed and course to avoid areas of high turbulence, and using noise reduction technologies such as active noise control systems.



In conclusion, turbulence plays a significant role in the generation of ship noise. Understanding the relationship between turbulence and ship noise can help in designing quieter ships and implementing effective noise control strategies. This is particularly important for military vessels, where noise control is a critical aspect of stealth technology.



#### 13.3a Turbulence and Air Quality



Turbulence in the atmosphere plays a significant role in the dispersion and distribution of pollutants, thereby directly affecting air quality. This is particularly evident in instances of haze, where the movement and concentration of pollutants are largely determined by atmospheric turbulence.



The 2006 Southeast Asian haze provides a clear example of how turbulence can impact air quality. In this case, the haze, which originated from forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan, was carried by winds to Singapore, causing significant fluctuations in the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) readings. The PSI readings, which measure the concentration of pollutants in the air, breached the 100 mark on 7 October 2006, indicating unhealthy levels of air quality for the first time that year.



The distribution and concentration of the haze were largely influenced by atmospheric turbulence. Turbulence, caused by the chaotic and irregular motion of air, can enhance the dispersion of pollutants, spreading them over a larger area and reducing their concentration. However, in the absence of turbulence, pollutants can remain concentrated in a specific area, leading to poor air quality.



In the case of the 2006 Southeast Asian haze, the arrival of the Northeast monsoon rains, which typically bring turbulent winds, was expected to improve air quality by dispersing the haze. However, the onset of the rains was delayed due to a mild El Niño effect, resulting in prolonged periods of poor air quality.



Furthermore, the direction and speed of the winds, which are influenced by atmospheric turbulence, played a crucial role in determining the movement of the haze. Southeasterly winds, for instance, carried the haze from Kalimantan across the South China Sea to Singapore.



In conclusion, turbulence in the atmosphere plays a crucial role in determining air quality. Understanding the relationship between turbulence and air quality can help in the development of effective strategies for air pollution control and management. Future research in this area could focus on developing models to predict the dispersion of pollutants based on atmospheric turbulence patterns.



#### 13.3b Turbulence and Water Quality



Turbulence in water bodies, much like in the atmosphere, plays a significant role in the dispersion and distribution of pollutants, thereby directly affecting water quality. This is particularly evident in estuaries, where the mixing of freshwater and saltwater creates a unique environment for turbulence.



The field studies conducted in the estuarine zone of Eprapah Creek between 2003 and 2007 provide a clear example of how turbulence can impact water quality. These studies aimed to investigate the turbulence and turbulent mixing properties in the estuarine zone, with a focus on the implications for the modelling of small estuaries.



The findings from these studies showed that the response of the turbulence and water quality properties were distinct under spring and neap tidal forcing and behaved differently in the middle and upper estuarine zones. This behavior of turbulence properties to spring tidal forcing differed from that observed in larger estuaries and seemed unique to small estuarine systems.



One of the key findings was that many assumptions used in larger estuaries must be applied with caution or are simply untrue in small estuaries. For instance, the assumption that the mixing coefficient parameters are constant over the tidal cycle in a small estuary is simply untrue. This highlights the need for continued study of small estuaries to properly understand this type of system.



Eprapah Creek, like most small subtropical estuaries, is characterized by short-lived freshwater flushing, and basically no flow during the dry season. A recent field study highlighted the short-term impact of a rainstorm on a small subtropical estuary. The flushing appeared to be caused primarily by the rainfall runoff from the nearby shopping centers, parkings, and roadways. In the estuary, the surface flows were dominated by the freshwater flushing including during the flood tide.



In conclusion, turbulence in water bodies plays a crucial role in determining water quality. Understanding the relationship between turbulence and water quality can help in the development of effective environmental engineering strategies and models. This understanding can also aid in the prediction and mitigation of pollution events, thereby protecting our water resources and the ecosystems that depend on them.



#### 13.3c Turbulence and Soil Erosion



Turbulence plays a significant role in soil erosion, particularly in arid environments where wind is the dominant force of sediment transport. The process of wind erosion involves the removal, transport, and deposition of soil particles by the wind, and turbulence is a key factor in each of these stages.



Wind erosion begins when the wind velocity exceeds the fluid threshold, which is the minimum wind velocity required to dislodge soil particles from the surface. Once the wind velocity surpasses this threshold, a cascade effect occurs where dislodged particles tear loose other particles, leading to continued transport until the wind velocity drops below the dynamic threshold, or impact threshold. This threshold is usually lower than the fluid threshold, indicating a hysteresis in the wind transport system.



Particles are transported by winds through three primary mechanisms: suspension, saltation, and creeping. Turbulent air motion supports the weight of suspended particles, allowing them to be transported for great distances. This is particularly effective for sediment grains under 0.05 mm in size, which can be separated from coarser grains as suspended particles.



Saltation refers to the downwind movement of particles in a series of jumps or skips. This is most important for grains of up to 2 mm in size. A saltating grain may hit other grains that jump up to continue the saltation. The grain may also hit larger grains (over 2 mm in size) that are too heavy to hop, but that slowly creep forward as they are pushed by saltating grains.



Creeping is the slow, rolling or sliding movement of larger grains that are pushed by saltating grains. This process is slower than saltation and suspension, but it contributes to the overall transport of soil particles.



The interaction between turbulence and soil erosion is complex and multifaceted. Turbulence can enhance soil erosion by increasing the energy of the wind and its capacity to transport soil particles. However, it can also reduce soil erosion by causing a redistribution of wind energy and reducing the wind velocity at the soil surface.



Understanding the role of turbulence in soil erosion is crucial for environmental engineering, particularly in the design and implementation of soil conservation strategies. Future research should focus on improving our understanding of the complex interactions between turbulence, soil properties, and wind erosion processes. This will help to develop more effective strategies for soil conservation and sustainable land management.



#### 13.3d Turbulence and Wind Energy



Turbulence plays a crucial role in the field of wind energy, particularly in the design and operation of wind turbines. The interaction of wind turbulence with the turbine blades can significantly impact the power output and the structural integrity of the turbine.



Wind turbines are designed to extract energy from the wind, converting kinetic energy into mechanical energy, and subsequently into electrical energy. The efficiency of this energy conversion process is highly dependent on the wind speed. However, the wind speed is not constant but fluctuates due to turbulence in the atmosphere. This fluctuation, or turbulence intensity, is a measure of the wind's unsteadiness and can significantly affect the power output of a wind turbine.



The Sandia method, as discussed in the related context, is a powerful tool for simulating wind turbulence. This method generates a spectral matrix, $S(\omega_k)$, which encapsulates information about the turbulence intensity at each point on the surface. This matrix is used to obtain the complex Fourier coefficients of the Fourier transforms of the time series of the wind speeds at all the points on the surface.



The turbulence intensity, represented by the power spectra in the spectral matrix, can be used to predict the power output of a wind turbine. The higher the turbulence intensity, the more unsteady the wind, and the more fluctuation in the power output. This fluctuation can lead to wear and tear on the turbine blades and other components, reducing the lifespan of the wind turbine.



Moreover, the turbulence intensity can also affect the design of wind turbines. Turbines designed for high turbulence intensities need to be more robust to withstand the unsteady wind loads. On the other hand, turbines designed for low turbulence intensities can be more lightweight and cost-effective.



In conclusion, understanding and accurately simulating wind turbulence is crucial for the efficient and sustainable operation of wind turbines. The Sandia method provides a powerful tool for this purpose, enabling engineers to design and operate wind turbines that can withstand the challenges posed by wind turbulence.



#### 13.4a Turbulence and Machine Design



Turbulence plays a significant role in the field of mechanical engineering, particularly in machine design. The interaction of turbulence with machine components can significantly impact the performance, efficiency, and lifespan of the machine. 



In the context of mechanical engineering, turbulence is often encountered in fluid flow systems, such as pumps, turbines, and heat exchangers. The turbulence in these systems can lead to increased energy losses, reduced efficiency, and accelerated wear and tear on the components. Therefore, understanding and accurately simulating turbulence is crucial for the design and operation of these machines.



For instance, in the design of gas turbines, as discussed in the related context, the operation at extremely high RPM can lead to narrow powerbands and poor throttleability and throttle response. This is due to the high levels of turbulence generated at these speeds. The turbulence can lead to increased energy losses due to friction and heat transfer, reducing the overall efficiency of the turbine.



The Boussinesq hypothesis, employed in the Spalart–Allmaras (S–A), "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon), and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models, offers a relatively low-cost computation for the turbulence viscosity $\nu_t$. These models can be used to simulate the turbulence in these machines and predict their performance under different operating conditions.



In the design of rotary engines, such as the General Motors Rotary Combustion Engine, turbulence plays a crucial role in the combustion process. The turbulence can enhance the mixing of the fuel and air, leading to more efficient combustion and higher power output. However, excessive turbulence can lead to uneven combustion and increased emissions. Therefore, the design of the combustion chamber and the operating conditions need to be carefully optimized to achieve the right balance of turbulence.



In conclusion, understanding and accurately simulating turbulence is crucial for the design and operation of machines in mechanical engineering. The use of turbulence models, such as the S–A, "k"–ε, and "k"–ω models, can provide valuable insights into the behavior of turbulence in these machines and guide the design process.



#### 13.4b Turbulence and Machine Performance



Turbulence not only influences the design of machines but also their performance. The interaction of turbulence with machine components can lead to a variety of effects, some of which can be beneficial, while others can be detrimental.



In the realm of mechanical engineering, the performance of machines is often evaluated in terms of their efficiency, power output, and reliability. Turbulence can impact all these aspects, either directly or indirectly.



For instance, in the case of gas turbines, the high levels of turbulence generated at high RPM can lead to increased energy losses due to friction and heat transfer. This, in turn, reduces the overall efficiency of the turbine. However, the turbulence can also enhance the mixing of the fuel and air, leading to more efficient combustion and higher power output. Therefore, the performance of the turbine is a delicate balance between these opposing effects of turbulence.



Similarly, in the case of rotary engines, turbulence plays a crucial role in the combustion process. While the turbulence can enhance the mixing of the fuel and air, leading to more efficient combustion and higher power output, excessive turbulence can lead to uneven combustion and increased emissions. Therefore, the performance of the engine is also a balance between these opposing effects of turbulence.



In the context of graphics processing units (GPUs), such as the AMD Radeon Pro and NVIDIA Quadro series, turbulence can impact the thermal performance of the units. The turbulence generated by the cooling fans can enhance the heat transfer from the GPU to the surrounding air, improving the thermal performance of the unit. However, excessive turbulence can lead to increased noise and vibration, which can reduce the reliability and lifespan of the unit.



In conclusion, understanding and accurately simulating turbulence is crucial for predicting and optimizing the performance of machines. The Boussinesq hypothesis, employed in the Spalart–Allmaras (S–A), "k"–ε ("k"–epsilon), and "k"–ω ("k"–omega) models, offers a relatively low-cost computation for the turbulence viscosity $\nu_t$. These models can be used to simulate the turbulence in these machines and predict their performance under different operating conditions.



#### 13.4c Turbulence and Machine Safety



Turbulence, while having significant impacts on machine performance, also plays a crucial role in machine safety. The effects of turbulence can lead to safety concerns in various engineering applications, particularly in mechanical engineering.



In the context of rotary engines, such as the Gnome rotary engine used in the Caudron Type D, turbulence can lead to uneven combustion. This uneven combustion can result in increased emissions and, in severe cases, can cause engine failure. Engine failure, particularly during operation, can pose significant safety risks. Therefore, understanding and controlling turbulence is crucial for ensuring the safe operation of rotary engines[^1^].



Similarly, in the case of gas turbines, the high levels of turbulence generated at high RPM can lead to increased heat transfer. This can result in overheating of the turbine components, which can lead to component failure and pose significant safety risks. Therefore, effective cooling systems are required to manage the heat generated by turbulence and ensure the safe operation of gas turbines[^2^].



In the realm of factory automation, turbulence can lead to increased noise and vibration. This can not only reduce the reliability and lifespan of the machinery but can also pose safety risks to the operators. For instance, excessive vibration can lead to structural failure of the machinery, while high noise levels can cause hearing damage to the operators[^3^].



In the case of vehicles, such as the Kia Rio and the Radical RXC, turbulence can impact the aerodynamics of the vehicle. This can affect the vehicle's stability and handling, particularly at high speeds, and can lead to safety concerns. Therefore, understanding and controlling turbulence is crucial for the design of safe and efficient vehicles[^4^].



In conclusion, turbulence, while having significant impacts on machine performance, also has crucial implications for machine safety. Understanding and accurately simulating turbulence is therefore not only crucial for optimizing machine performance but also for ensuring machine safety.

#### 13.4d Turbulence and Machine Noise



Turbulence, in addition to its impact on machine performance and safety, also significantly contributes to machine noise. This noise can be a nuisance in residential areas, can disrupt the working environment, and can even lead to hearing damage in severe cases[^5^].



In the context of mechanical engineering, machine noise is often a result of turbulent flow. For instance, in rotary engines such as the Gnome rotary engine used in the Caudron Type D, turbulence can lead to uneven combustion. This uneven combustion can result in increased noise levels, which can be disruptive and potentially harmful[^6^].



Similarly, in gas turbines, the high levels of turbulence generated at high RPM can lead to increased noise levels. This noise can be a significant issue, particularly in urban areas where noise pollution is a concern. Therefore, effective noise reduction strategies are required to manage the noise generated by turbulence in gas turbines[^7^].



In the realm of factory automation, turbulence can lead to increased noise and vibration. This noise can not only reduce the reliability and lifespan of the machinery but can also disrupt the working environment and pose health risks to the operators. Therefore, effective noise reduction strategies are crucial in factory automation[^8^].



In the case of vehicles, turbulence can impact the aerodynamics of the vehicle and lead to increased noise levels. This noise can be disruptive to the driver and passengers and can also contribute to environmental noise pollution. Therefore, understanding and controlling turbulence is crucial for the design of quiet and efficient vehicles[^9^].



In conclusion, turbulence, while having significant impacts on machine performance and safety, also has crucial implications for machine noise. Understanding and controlling turbulence can help to reduce machine noise and improve the quality of life for those living and working in proximity to these machines[^10^].

## Chapter: Chapter 14: Turbululence in Biological Fluids:



### Introduction



Turbulence, a complex phenomenon that has been extensively studied in the context of the ocean and atmosphere, also plays a significant role in biological systems. This chapter, "Turbulence in Biological Fluids," aims to delve into the intricate world of biological turbulence, exploring its characteristics, implications, and the mathematical models used to describe it.



Biological fluids, such as blood in the circulatory system or air in the respiratory system, exhibit turbulent behavior under certain conditions. This turbulence can have significant effects on the function of these systems, influencing nutrient and oxygen transport, waste removal, and even the progression of certain diseases. Understanding the nature of turbulence in these biological fluids is not only crucial for a comprehensive understanding of human physiology but also has potential implications for medical diagnostics and treatment.



The study of turbulence in biological fluids is a complex task, requiring a blend of fluid dynamics, biology, and mathematics. In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe turbulence in biological fluids, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, and how these models are adapted to account for the unique properties of biological fluids. 



We will also discuss the experimental techniques used to study turbulence in biological fluids, from high-speed imaging to particle image velocimetry. These techniques allow researchers to visualize and quantify turbulence, providing valuable insights into its behavior and effects.



In conclusion, turbulence is not just a phenomenon of the ocean and atmosphere, but also a critical aspect of biological systems. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of turbulence in biological fluids, offering a unique perspective on this fascinating and complex phenomenon.



### Section: 14.1 Turbulence in the Cardiovascular System:



The cardiovascular system, a complex network of blood vessels and the heart, is responsible for the transport of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body. The flow of blood within this system is not always smooth and laminar; under certain conditions, it can become turbulent, leading to significant implications for cardiovascular function and health.



#### Subsection: 14.1a Turbulence and Heart Function



One of the most intriguing aspects of turbulence in the cardiovascular system is its role in heart function. The heart, as the central pump of the cardiovascular system, is particularly sensitive to changes in blood flow patterns. Turbulence within the heart can affect the heart's rhythm, leading to a phenomenon known as heart rate turbulence (HRT).



HRT is a baroreflex-mediated adjustment of heart rate that acts as a counter-mechanism to premature ventricular contraction (PVC). It consists of a brief speed-up in heart rate, followed by a slow decrease back to the baseline rate. PVCs can occur naturally in most otherwise-healthy adults, so measuring the characteristics of a given person's HRT can offer a non-invasive way to evaluate certain aspects of their cardiac or autonomic function without applying artificial external stimuli[^1^].



The measured values of HRT parameters have been shown to be a statistically significant prediction of the probability of dying from cardiac disease after a patient suffers a myocardial infarction[^2^]. HRT can also be used to predict death in patients with congestive heart failure from a lethal arrhythmia[^3^].



The concept of HRT was introduced to the medical community by Georg Schmidt and colleagues from the Technical University of Munich in 1999[^4^]. While studying PVC characteristics, Schmidt and his colleagues noticed that heart rate seemed to speed up after a PVC. They proceeded to test this hypothesis using 24-hour electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) recordings, confirming their observations and highlighting the importance of HRT in cardiac health.



In conclusion, turbulence in the cardiovascular system, particularly in the context of heart function, is a complex and fascinating phenomenon. Understanding the nature and implications of this turbulence is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of cardiovascular physiology and for the development of effective diagnostic and treatment strategies.

#### Subsection: 14.1b Turbulence and Blood Flow



Turbulence in blood flow is another critical aspect of the cardiovascular system. Blood flow in the body is generally laminar, meaning it flows in parallel layers with minimal mixing. However, under certain conditions, such as high flow rates or irregularities in the blood vessels, the flow can become turbulent.



Turbulent blood flow is characterized by chaotic, multidirectional flow patterns. This can be problematic in the cardiovascular system as it increases the energy required to pump blood and can lead to inefficient nutrient and oxygen delivery. Furthermore, turbulent flow can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries[^5^].



The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity used to predict the onset of turbulence in fluid flow. It is defined as:



$$

Re = \frac{{\rho v L}}{{\mu}}

$$



where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $L$ is the characteristic length (typically the diameter of the blood vessel), and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. When the Reynolds number exceeds a critical value (approximately 2000 for blood flow), the flow becomes turbulent[^6^].



Turbulence in blood flow can be detected using Doppler ultrasound, a non-invasive technique that measures the velocity of blood flow. The presence of turbulence is indicated by a high-intensity, broad-spectrum Doppler signal[^7^].



Understanding and predicting turbulence in blood flow is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. For example, turbulence near heart valves can indicate valve dysfunction, while turbulence in the arteries can signal the presence of atherosclerosis[^8^].

#### Subsection: 14.1c Turbulence and Cardiovascular Disease



Turbulence in the cardiovascular system is not only a physical phenomenon but also has significant implications for health and disease. Turbulent blood flow can contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including atherosclerosis and heart valve diseases[^9^].



Atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, is a leading cause of CVD. Turbulent blood flow can exacerbate atherosclerosis by causing damage to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, promoting inflammation, and facilitating the deposition and accumulation of cholesterol and other substances in the arterial wall[^10^].



Heart valve diseases, such as stenosis and regurgitation, can also be associated with turbulence. In stenosis, the narrowing of the heart valves can lead to increased velocity and turbulence of blood flow, resulting in increased workload for the heart. In regurgitation, the backflow of blood can cause turbulence, leading to inefficient blood flow and increased heart strain[^11^].



Moreover, psychosocial factors and occupational stressors can indirectly contribute to turbulence in the cardiovascular system. High-strain jobs that combine high workload and little autonomy can lead to chronic stress, which can increase blood pressure and heart rate variability (HRV). These physiological changes can alter the flow dynamics in the cardiovascular system, potentially increasing the likelihood of turbulence and its associated health risks[^12^].



Therefore, understanding and managing turbulence in the cardiovascular system is crucial for preventing and treating CVD. This includes not only medical interventions to control blood pressure and cholesterol levels but also lifestyle modifications and stress management strategies to reduce the psychosocial risk factors for turbulence and CVD[^13^].

#### Subsection: 14.1d Turbulence and Cardiovascular Imaging



Cardiovascular imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It provides a non-invasive method to visualize the structure and function of the heart and blood vessels, enabling the detection of abnormalities such as atherosclerosis and heart valve diseases[^14^]. However, turbulence in the cardiovascular system can pose challenges to cardiovascular imaging.



Turbulence in blood flow can cause signal loss and image artifacts in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and Doppler ultrasound imaging[^15^]. This is because the rapid and chaotic motion of turbulent blood can dephase the magnetic spins or scatter the ultrasound waves, leading to a loss of signal coherence. As a result, areas of turbulence may appear as signal voids or noisy regions in the images, potentially obscuring the underlying pathology[^16^].



To overcome this challenge, various imaging techniques and post-processing algorithms have been developed to detect and quantify turbulence. For example, phase-contrast CMR can measure the velocity of blood flow in three dimensions, allowing the visualization and quantification of turbulence[^17^]. Similarly, Doppler ultrasound can detect the spectral broadening caused by turbulence, providing a measure of the turbulence intensity[^18^].



Moreover, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to simulate the blood flow and turbulence based on the anatomical information obtained from imaging. This can provide a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the flow dynamics in the cardiovascular system, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment planning of CVD[^19^].



However, these techniques and algorithms require careful calibration and interpretation, as they can be influenced by various factors such as the imaging parameters, patient's heart rate, and blood viscosity[^20^]. Therefore, further research and development are needed to improve the accuracy and reliability of turbulence imaging in the cardiovascular system.

#### Subsection: 14.2a Turbulence and Lung Function



Turbulence in the respiratory system, particularly in the lungs, plays a significant role in the distribution and transport of inhaled gases. The lungs' complex branching structure, which includes the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, facilitates the rapid exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the bloodstream[^21^]. However, the flow of air in these structures is not always smooth or laminar. Instead, it can become turbulent, especially during high flow rates or in the presence of obstructions such as mucus or narrowed airways[^22^].



Turbulence in the lungs can be studied using various imaging techniques, such as Vibration Response Imaging (VRI). VRI provides information on lung sound behavior and vibration energy during inspiration and expiration[^23^]. The distribution pattern of normal lung vibration energy evolves centrally and develops centrifugally in a simultaneous fashion for both lungs. Following peak inspiration, there is a centripetal regression of vibration energy. The peak of inspiratory vibration energy is higher than the expiratory energy peak, reflecting the more active process of inspiration compared to expiration[^24^].



However, lung ailments such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can cause the narrowing of airways in the lungs, limiting airflow and potentially increasing turbulence[^25^]. This can disrupt the normal distribution pattern of lung vibration energy, leading to changes in the VRI graphs. For example, the peak of inspiratory vibration energy may be lower, and the regression of vibration energy may be slower or incomplete[^26^].



Furthermore, turbulence in the lungs can affect the transport and deposition of inhaled particles, such as aerosol medications or pollutants. The chaotic motion of turbulent air can enhance the mixing and dispersion of particles, potentially increasing their deposition in the peripheral regions of the lungs[^27^]. However, it can also lead to unpredictable and non-uniform deposition patterns, which can affect the efficacy of inhaled medications or the health effects of inhaled pollutants[^28^].



Therefore, understanding and quantifying turbulence in the lungs is crucial for the diagnosis and management of respiratory diseases, as well as for the design and optimization of inhaled therapies. Further research is needed to develop more accurate and reliable methods for measuring lung turbulence, and to elucidate the complex interactions between turbulence, lung structure, and particle transport[^29^].



#### Subsection: 14.2b Turbulence and Air Flow



The flow of air in the respiratory system is a complex process that can be influenced by various factors, including the physical structure of the airways, the rate of airflow, and the presence of obstructions[^28^]. Under normal conditions, the flow of air in the respiratory system is predominantly laminar, characterized by smooth, parallel layers of fluid that move at different velocities[^29^]. However, under certain conditions, the flow can become turbulent, characterized by chaotic, irregular fluctuations in velocity[^30^].



The transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the respiratory system can be described using the Reynolds number (Re), a dimensionless quantity that predicts the onset of turbulence in fluid flow. The Reynolds number is defined as:



$$

Re = \frac{\rho u d}{\mu}

$$



where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $u$ is the fluid velocity, $d$ is the hydraulic diameter (characteristic length), and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity[^31^]. In the respiratory system, the Reynolds number can be influenced by factors such as the rate of airflow, the diameter of the airways, and the physical properties of the air[^32^].



Turbulence in the respiratory system can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. On one hand, turbulence can enhance the mixing and dispersion of inhaled gases and particles, potentially improving the efficiency of gas exchange and the deposition of aerosol medications[^33^]. On the other hand, turbulence can increase the resistance to airflow, potentially leading to breathing difficulties, especially in individuals with respiratory diseases such as asthma or COPD[^34^].



Furthermore, turbulence in the respiratory system can generate noise, which can be used as a diagnostic tool in medical imaging techniques such as Vibration Response Imaging (VRI)[^35^]. The analysis of turbulence-induced noise can provide valuable information about the functional status of the lungs and the presence of potential abnormalities[^36^].



In conclusion, understanding the dynamics of turbulence in the respiratory system is crucial for optimizing respiratory function, improving drug delivery, and diagnosing respiratory diseases. Future research in this area could focus on developing more accurate models of turbulent flow in the respiratory system, as well as exploring novel methods for manipulating turbulence to enhance therapeutic outcomes[^37^].

#### Subsection: 14.2c Turbulence and Respiratory Disease



Turbulence in the respiratory system can have significant implications for respiratory health, particularly in the context of exposure to particulate matter (PM). PM, which includes a broad range of particles of varying sizes and compositions, can be inhaled into the respiratory system and interact with the airways and lung tissues[^36^]. The effects of PM on respiratory health can be influenced by various factors, including the size and composition of the particles, the duration and intensity of exposure, and the individual's health status[^37^].



In the context of turbulence, the chaotic and irregular flow patterns can enhance the deposition of inhaled PM in the respiratory system[^38^]. This can increase the exposure of the airways and lung tissues to the harmful effects of PM, potentially leading to inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue damage[^39^]. Furthermore, the enhanced deposition of PM can exacerbate the symptoms of respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and increase the risk of cardiovascular events[^40^].



A 2002 study indicated that PM<sub>2.5</sub> leads to high plaque deposits in arteries, causing vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis[^41^]. A 2014 meta-analysis reported that long-term exposure to PM is linked to coronary events[^42^]. In 2017, a study revealed that PM not only affects human cells and tissues, but also impacts bacteria which cause disease in humans[^43^].



The largest US study on acute health effects of coarse particle pollution between 2.5 and 10 micrometers in diameter found an association with hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases but no evidence of an association with the number of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases[^44^]. However, after taking into account fine particle levels (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and less), the association with coarse particles remained but was no longer statistically significant[^45^].



The Mongolian government agency recorded a 45% increase in the rate of respiratory illness in the past five years (reported in 2011). Bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial pneumonia were the most common ailments treated by area hospitals[^46^].



In conclusion, turbulence in the respiratory system can play a significant role in the health effects of inhaled PM, particularly in individuals with pre-existing respiratory diseases. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interactions between turbulence, PM, and respiratory health, and to develop effective strategies for reducing the health risks associated with PM exposure.

#### Subsection: 14.2d Turbulence and Respiratory Imaging



The study of turbulence in the respiratory system has been greatly enhanced by advancements in imaging technology. One such advancement is the application of velocimetry to medical images, which allows for regional measurements of blood flow and tissue motion[^45^]. This technique was initially adapted to work with x-ray images, enabling the measurement of opaque flows such as blood flow[^46^]. 



Computed tomographic x-ray velocimetry is a technique that has been developed to extract 3D measurements from 2D image sequences[^47^]. This technique generates a model solution and compares the cross-correlations of the model to the cross-correlation from the image sequence. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the regional motion of lung tissue, which can be a sensitive indicator of regional lung disease[^48^].



Another imaging technique that has been used to study turbulence in the respiratory system is fractal flame algorithm. This algorithm is like a Monte Carlo simulation, with the flame quality directly proportional to the number of iterations of the simulation[^49^]. The noise that results from this stochastic sampling can be reduced by blurring the image, to get a smoother result in less time. This is achieved through adaptive density estimation, which varies the width of the filter inversely proportional to the number of samples available[^50^]. As a result, areas with few samples and high noise become blurred and smoothed, but areas with many samples and low noise are left unaffected[^51^].



These imaging techniques have provided valuable insights into the nature of turbulence in the respiratory system and its implications for respiratory health. They have also opened up new avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases, by allowing for a more detailed and accurate assessment of lung function and tissue health[^52^].

#### Subsection: 14.3a Turbulence and Stomach Function



The stomach, a key component of the digestive system, is a complex organ that performs a variety of functions, including the mechanical breakdown of food, secretion of digestive enzymes, and regulation of the passage of chyme into the small intestine[^53^]. The stomach's function is influenced by a variety of factors, including the autonomic nervous system, digestive hormones, and the physical and chemical properties of the food ingested[^54^]. 



One of the key aspects of stomach function is the generation of turbulence. Turbulence in the stomach is primarily generated by the peristaltic contractions of the stomach wall, which mix and churn the food with gastric secretions to form chyme[^55^]. This turbulence is crucial for the mechanical breakdown of food and the mixing of food with digestive enzymes, which facilitates the chemical digestion of food[^56^].



The generation of turbulence in the stomach is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. The autonomic nervous system plays a key role in regulating the strength and frequency of peristaltic contractions, with the parasympathetic nervous system generally promoting contractions and the sympathetic nervous system inhibiting them[^57^]. Digestive hormones also play a role in regulating stomach contractions, with hormones such as gastrin promoting contractions and hormones such as secretin and cholecystokinin inhibiting them[^58^].



The physical and chemical properties of the food ingested also influence the generation of turbulence in the stomach. For example, the viscosity of the food can influence the degree of turbulence, with more viscous foods generating more turbulence[^59^]. Similarly, the pH of the food can influence the activity of the digestive enzymes in the stomach, which can in turn influence the degree of turbulence[^60^].



In addition to its role in digestion, turbulence in the stomach also plays a role in the regulation of gastric emptying. The pyloric sphincter, which controls the passage of chyme from the stomach to the small intestine, is sensitive to the degree of turbulence in the stomach, with greater turbulence promoting the opening of the sphincter[^61^]. This ensures that the chyme is adequately mixed and digested before it is passed on to the small intestine[^62^].



In conclusion, turbulence in the stomach plays a crucial role in the digestion of food and the regulation of gastric emptying. Understanding the factors that influence the generation of turbulence in the stomach can provide valuable insights into the function of the digestive system and may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of digestive disorders[^63^].

#### Subsection: 14.3b Turbulence and Food Digestion



Turbulence plays a significant role in the digestion of food, particularly in the stomach and intestines. The churning and mixing of food with digestive enzymes, facilitated by the turbulence generated by peristaltic contractions, is crucial for the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food[^61^].



In the context of food digestion, turbulence can be influenced by the type of food ingested. For instance, research conducted by De Nys and his team at JCU in 2013 and 2015 demonstrated the impact of dietary seaweed on the turbulence and subsequent digestion process in an artificial cow stomach[^62^]. The team found that the addition of "Asparagopsis taxiformis" seaweed to the diet significantly reduced methane emissions, a byproduct of the digestion process, without compromising the health of the digestive system[^63^].



The turbulence generated in the stomach and intestines also plays a role in the absorption of nutrients. The churning and mixing of food with digestive enzymes increases the surface area of the food particles, facilitating the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream[^64^]. This process is particularly important in the small intestine, where the majority of nutrient absorption occurs[^65^].



However, excessive turbulence in the digestive system can lead to digestive issues. For example, excessive turbulence can lead to the overproduction of stomach acid, which can result in conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers[^66^]. Therefore, while turbulence is crucial for the digestion of food, it must be carefully regulated to ensure optimal digestive health.



In conclusion, turbulence plays a crucial role in the digestion of food, influencing the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, the absorption of nutrients, and the production of byproducts such as methane. However, the regulation of turbulence is crucial to ensure optimal digestive health and prevent digestive issues.

#### Subsection: 14.3c Turbulence and Digestive Disease



Turbulence in the digestive system, while crucial for the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients, can also contribute to the development of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) when not properly regulated[^67^]. The pathophysiology of FGIDs is complex and multifactorial, involving a combination of early life factors, psychosocial factors, and physiological factors[^68^].



The turbulence generated by the peristaltic contractions of the digestive system can influence the motility and sensitivity of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, two key physiological features associated with FGIDs[^69^]. For instance, excessive turbulence can lead to increased motor reactivity, resulting in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia[^70^].



Furthermore, turbulence can affect the barrier function of the GI tract, another physiological feature associated with FGIDs[^71^]. Excessive turbulence can lead to the disruption of the intestinal barrier, allowing for the translocation of bacteria and other harmful substances from the gut lumen into the bloodstream[^72^]. This can trigger an immune response and lead to inflammation, contributing to the development of FGIDs[^73^].



The brain-gut axis, which is the communication pathway between the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain and the GI tract, also plays a role in the relationship between turbulence and FGIDs[^74^]. Turbulence in the digestive system can stimulate the brain-gut axis, exacerbating gastrointestinal symptoms and potentially contributing to the development of FGIDs[^75^]. For example, psychological stress can stimulate the production of stomach acid, which can lead to conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers[^76^].



In conclusion, while turbulence is crucial for the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients, it can also contribute to the development of FGIDs when not properly regulated. Understanding the complex interactions between turbulence, the brain-gut axis, and the physiological features associated with FGIDs can provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of these disorders and inform the development of effective treatment strategies[^77^].



#### Subsection: 14.3d Turbulence and Digestive Imaging



The study of turbulence in the digestive system has been greatly enhanced by the development of imaging techniques that allow for the visualization of fluid flow within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract[^77^]. One such technique is the use of optical flow methods, which estimate the motion between two image frames taken at times $t$ and $t+\Delta t$ at every voxel position[^78^].



These methods are based on local Taylor series approximations of the image signal, using partial derivatives with respect to the spatial and temporal coordinates[^79^]. For a (2D + "t")-dimensional case, a voxel at location $(x,y,t)$ with intensity $I(x,y,t)$ will have moved by $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$ and $\Delta t$ between the two image frames[^80^].



The following "brightness constancy constraint" can be given:



$$

I(x,y,t) = I(x+\Delta x, y+\Delta y, t+\Delta t)

$$



Assuming the movement to be small, the image constraint at $I(x,y,t)$ with Taylor series can be developed to get:



$$

I(x+\Delta x, y+\Delta y, t+\Delta t) = I(x,y,t) + \frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\Delta x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\Delta y + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\Delta t

$$



By truncating the higher order terms (which performs a linearization), it follows that:



$$

\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\Delta x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\Delta y + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t}\Delta t = 0

$$



or, dividing by $\Delta t$,



$$

\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}V_x + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}V_y + \frac{\partial I}{\partial t} = 0

$$



where $V_x,V_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity or optical flow of $I(x,y,t)$ and $\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial I}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}$ are the derivatives of the image at $(x,y,t)$ in the corresponding directions[^81^].



This equation, however, is in two unknowns and cannot be solved as such. This is known as the "aperture problem" in optical flow estimation[^82^]. Despite this limitation, optical flow methods have proven to be valuable tools in the study of turbulence in the digestive system, providing insights into the dynamics of fluid flow and the effects of turbulence on digestive function[^83^].



In conclusion, the use of imaging techniques such as optical flow methods has greatly enhanced our understanding of turbulence in the digestive system. These techniques provide valuable insights into the dynamics of fluid flow within the GI tract and the effects of turbulence on digestive function[^84^].



### Section: 14.4 Turbulence in the Urinary System:



The urinary system, also known as the renal system, is a group of organs in the body that filters out excess fluid and other substances from the bloodstream. The formation of urine involves highly complex processes of filtration, reabsorption, and tubular secretion, all of which occur in the kidneys[^83^]. The turbulence in the urinary system can be studied in relation to kidney function, particularly in the context of diseases such as Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN).



#### Subsection: 14.4a Turbulence and Kidney Function



The kidneys are responsible for maintaining the body's internal equilibrium of water and minerals, including sodium, potassium, and phosphate. This is achieved through the process of filtration, where blood is filtered through the glomerulus, a network of tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, and the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules[^84^]. 



Turbulence in the urinary system can occur due to various factors, including heat stress, dehydration, and disturbances in water and mineral balance. These factors can lead to functional and sub-clinical acute kidney injuries (AKI), and repetitive AKI may lead to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD)[^85^].



Heat stress and dehydration are particularly relevant in the context of MeN, a form of CKD prevalent among agricultural workers in Central America. High temperatures, high sweat rates, and limited fluid intake can lead to disturbances in the renal filtration process, causing turbulence in the urinary system[^86^].



A study conducted in 2019 provided evidence of a dose-effect and dose-response relationship between high-heat and high workload exposure and increased episodes of AKI, as well as a progressive decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)[^87^]. This suggests that turbulence in the urinary system, induced by heat stress and dehydration, can contribute to the development of MeN.



The turbulence in the urinary system can also be influenced by the exposure to agrochemicals. However, the specific mechanisms by which these factors contribute to the development of MeN and other renal diseases are yet to be definitively established[^88^].



In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the role of turbulence in the urinary system, exploring its implications for kidney function and disease progression. We will also discuss potential strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of turbulence, with a focus on improving rest, hydration, and access to shade among high-risk populations[^89^].

#### Subsection: 14.4b Turbulence and Urine Flow



The flow of urine through the urinary system is another area where turbulence can be observed and studied. The urine flow starts from the kidneys, where it is produced, and ends at the bladder, where it is stored before being expelled from the body. The flow of urine is generally laminar, characterized by smooth, orderly layers of fluid[^88^]. However, under certain conditions, the flow can become turbulent, leading to a variety of health issues.



Turbulence in urine flow can be caused by several factors, including high urine flow rates, changes in the diameter of the urinary tract, and the presence of obstructions such as kidney stones[^89^]. High urine flow rates can occur due to excessive fluid intake or certain medical conditions, such as diabetes insipidus. Changes in the diameter of the urinary tract can be caused by inflammation, tumors, or anatomical abnormalities. Kidney stones, on the other hand, can cause turbulence by disrupting the smooth flow of urine.



Turbulent urine flow can lead to several health issues. For instance, it can cause increased pressure in the urinary tract, leading to discomfort and pain. It can also lead to the formation of bubbles in the urine, a condition known as cavitation. These bubbles can cause damage to the urinary tract and lead to the formation of more kidney stones[^90^].



The study of turbulence in urine flow can provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of various urinary disorders. For instance, understanding the role of turbulence in the formation of kidney stones can help in the development of preventive strategies and treatments. Similarly, understanding the effects of turbulence on the pressure in the urinary tract can help in the management of conditions such as urinary incontinence and bladder dysfunction[^91^].



In recent years, advances in imaging techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have made it possible to visualize and measure turbulence in the urinary system. These techniques, combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, can provide a detailed understanding of the dynamics of urine flow and the factors that contribute to turbulence[^92^].



Future research in this area could focus on developing more accurate and non-invasive methods for measuring turbulence in the urinary system. This could lead to better diagnostic tools and treatments for urinary disorders. Furthermore, the principles and methods used in the study of turbulence in the urinary system could also be applied to other biological fluids, opening up new avenues for research in the field of fluid dynamics.

#### Subsection: 14.4c Imaging Techniques for Studying Turbulence in Urine Flow



Imaging techniques have revolutionized the study of turbulence in biological fluids, including urine. These techniques allow for the visualization of fluid flow in real-time, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of turbulence in the urinary system[^92^].



Ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive technique that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the body. It can be used to visualize the flow of urine in the urinary tract, allowing for the detection of turbulence. Ultrasound imaging can also be used to measure the velocity of urine flow, which can provide information about the conditions under which turbulence occurs[^93^].



Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is another non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to study turbulence in urine flow. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It can provide high-resolution images of the urinary tract, allowing for the detection of changes in the diameter of the urinary tract and the presence of obstructions such as kidney stones[^94^]. MRI can also be used to measure the pressure in the urinary tract, providing information about the effects of turbulence on the urinary system[^95^].



Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a technique that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems involving fluid flows. CFD can be used to simulate the flow of urine in the urinary tract, providing a detailed picture of the dynamics of turbulence. It can also be used to study the effects of various factors on turbulence, such as changes in the diameter of the urinary tract and the presence of obstructions[^96^].



The combination of these imaging techniques with computational methods provides a powerful tool for studying turbulence in the urinary system. By providing a detailed picture of the dynamics of turbulence, these techniques can contribute to the development of preventive strategies and treatments for urinary disorders[^97^].



In conclusion, the study of turbulence in the urinary system is a complex but fascinating field that has the potential to provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of various urinary disorders. With the help of advanced imaging techniques and computational methods, it is now possible to visualize and study the dynamics of turbulence in the urinary system in unprecedented detail.
