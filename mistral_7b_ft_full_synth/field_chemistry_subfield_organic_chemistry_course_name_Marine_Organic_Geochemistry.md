## Foreward

Welcome to "Marine Organic Geochemistry: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and dynamic world of marine organic geochemistry. As we delve into the intricacies of this field, we will explore the various processes that shape the chemical composition of the ocean, from the influence of plate tectonics and seafloor spreading to the effects of large igneous provinces (LIPs) on marine productivity.

The Selli Event, a significant event in the history of the Earth's oceans, serves as a case study throughout this book. This event, characterized by a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), was likely driven by an increase in iron availability due to increased sulphate flux from volcanism. This increase in hydrogen sulphide production led to an increase in phosphorus availability in the water column, enabling the development of anoxia. The event also resulted in a drop in the pH of seawater and a decrease in seawater carbonate-saturation, marking the onset of ocean acidification.

The Selli Event also saw an increase in silicate weathering, as evidenced by δ7Li measurements indicating an enrichment in isotopically light lithium. This weathering may have helped to buffer the warming effects of large igneous province volcanism and cool the Earth back to its pre-OAE1a state.

The event also led to the widespread deposition of black shales rich in organic matter, incapable of being decomposed on the seabed due to anoxic conditions. This deposition began during the C6 stage of OAE1a and lasted for around 0.4 Myr.

As we explore the various aspects of marine organic geochemistry, we will also delve into the biotic effects of the Selli Event. Despite the significant changes in the chemical composition of the ocean, the biotic effects of the event were comparatively minor relative to other LIP-driven extinction events. This is a topic of ongoing research and debate, and we will explore the various perspectives and theories throughout this book.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT and anyone else interested in the fascinating world of marine organic geochemistry. It is my hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for those seeking to understand the complex and dynamic nature of the Earth's oceans.

Thank you for joining me on this journey into the depths of the ocean. Let's dive in and explore the world of marine organic geochemistry together.

## Chapter 2: Organic Geochemistry Applications




### Subsection 1.2c Case Studies in Organic Geochemistry

In addition to the analytical techniques discussed in the previous section, organic geochemists also use case studies to further understand the complex processes involved in the formation and alteration of organic matter. These case studies provide real-world examples and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the methods and concepts discussed in this chapter.

#### Case Study 1: Hydrogen Isotope Biogeochemistry

One important aspect of organic geochemistry is the study of hydrogen isotopes. Hydrogen isotopes, specifically deuterium and tritium, can provide valuable information about the origin and alteration of organic matter. For example, the first stage of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) after deposition is diagenesis, during which biological decomposition can alter the D/H ratio of organics.

Experimental studies have shown that some biodegraded materials become slightly enriched in D (less than 50‰). This is in contrast to most organics, which become kerogen by the end of diagenesis. The D/H ratio of kerogen can vary widely, with many factors contributing to the final value. For instance, research on Australian basins showed that kerogen from lacustrine algal sources with terrestrial contributions has a range of D/H ratios from -105‰ to -200‰, while kerogen from near-coastal depositional environments has a narrower range from -75‰ to -120‰. This narrower range is thought to reflect the relatively stable regional climate.

Coals, which are derived from type III kerogen, also exhibit a wide range of D/H ratios. Reddings et al. analyzed coals from various origins and found them randomly scattered across the range of -90‰ to -170‰. This variability is thought to be due to the influence of local meteoric water. However, Rigby et al. found that the D content decreases from -70‰ to -100‰ with increasing maturity in coal from the Bass Basin, which they attribute to later exchange with low D water. This suggests that coals can preserve much of the original D/H signal.

#### Case Study 2: Hydrogen Isotopes and Paleolatitude

Another important aspect of organic geochemistry is the study of hydrogen isotopes and their relationship to paleolatitude. Smith et al. studied H isotopes of coal samples from Antarctica and Australia and found a strong negative correlation between and inferred paleolatitude. For coal samples originating from near equatorial regions, is around -50‰, while for those originating from polar regions, is around -150‰. This trend along latitude is consistent with the meteoric water trend and thus is evidence that coals can preserve much of the original signal.

In conclusion, case studies provide valuable insights into the complex processes involved in the formation and alteration of organic matter. By studying hydrogen isotopes and their relationship to paleolatitude, organic geochemists can gain a better understanding of the origin and alteration of organic matter.

## Formats and the submission process

Since detailed proteomics data currently cannot be curated from the existing literature, the source of PRIDE data is solely submissions by academic researchers.

PRIDE is a standards-compliant public repository, meaning that its own XML-based data exchange format for submissions, PRIDE XML, was built around the Proteomics Standards Initiative mzData standard for mass spectrometry. Recently, PRIDE has been adapted to work with the modern mzML and mzIdentML standards of the Proteomics Standards Initiative. An additional format, dubbed mzTab, can be used as a simplified way to submit quantitative proteomics data.

As there are many types of different mass spectrometry instruments and software formats are currently on the market, wet-lab scientists without a strong bioinformatics background or informatics support were having problems converting their data to PRIDE XML. The development of PRIDE Converter helped to tackle this situation. PRIDE Converter is a tool, written in the Java programming language, that converts 15 different input mass spectrometry data formats into PRIDE XML via a wizard-like graphical user interface. It is freely available and is open source under the permissive Apache License. A new version of PRIDE Converter was released in 2012 as PRIDE Converter 2. This new version constituted a complete rewrite, focused on easy adaptability to different (and evolving) data sources.

## Browsing, searching and data mining PRIDE

Currently, data can be queried from PRIDE via the PRIDE web interface, through the stand-alone Java client PRIDE Inspector, or coupled directly to several search engines through PeptideShaker. Moreover, a new RESTful API allows convenient programmatic access to PRIDE data. This API provides a set of endpoints for retrieving data, including protein and peptide sequences, post-translational modifications, and experimental conditions. It also allows for the submission of new data, making it a powerful tool for researchers in the field of marine organic geochemistry.

### Section: 4.1 Carbon Isotope Fractionation in Marine Environments:

#### 4.1a Basics of Carbon Isotope Fractionation

Carbon isotope fractionation is a fundamental concept in marine organic geochemistry. It refers to the preferential uptake of certain carbon isotopes over others by biological and chemical processes. This phenomenon is driven by the differential affinity of carbon isotopes for chemical bonds, which can result in significant variations in the isotopic composition of organic matter.

The primary process responsible for carbon isotope fractionation in marine environments is photosynthesis. As mentioned in the previous context, photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and marine plankton, preferentially absorb lighter carbon isotopes, leading to an enrichment of these isotopes in the organism relative to the surrounding environment. This effect is quantified by the δ13C value, which is the ratio of the amount of 13C to 12C in a sample, expressed in parts per thousand (‰).

The δ13C value is a powerful tool for tracing the sources of organic matter in the ocean. For instance, terrestrial organic matter, which is primarily derived from the decomposition of land plants, has a δ13C value of around -25‰, while marine organic matter, which is primarily derived from marine plankton, has a δ13C value of around -18‰. By analyzing the δ13C value of organic matter, scientists can determine its source and track its movement in the ocean.

Carbon isotope fractionation is also influenced by other factors, such as temperature and salinity. For instance, higher temperatures can lead to a decrease in the δ13C value of organic matter, as the increased kinetic energy allows for more efficient uptake of lighter carbon isotopes. Similarly, higher salinity can lead to a decrease in the δ13C value, as the increased ionic strength can enhance the discrimination against heavier carbon isotopes.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mechanisms of carbon isotope fractionation and explore its implications for the study of marine organic matter. We will also discuss the role of carbon isotopes in tracing the transformation of organic matter in the ocean, from primary production to decomposition.

#### 4.1b Factors Affecting Carbon Isotope Fractionation

Several factors can influence the degree of carbon isotope fractionation in marine environments. These factors can be broadly categorized into biological, chemical, and physical factors.

##### Biological Factors

Biological factors play a crucial role in carbon isotope fractionation. As mentioned earlier, photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and marine plankton, preferentially absorb lighter carbon isotopes. This preference is driven by the differential affinity of carbon isotopes for chemical bonds. For instance, the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways, which are used by about 90% of all plant life, show a preference for lighter carbon isotopes. This preference leads to an enrichment of these isotopes in the organism relative to the surrounding environment, as quantified by the δ13C value.

##### Chemical Factors

Chemical factors can also influence carbon isotope fractionation. For instance, the oxidation of carbon can lead to a decrease in the δ13C value. This is because the oxidation process favors the uptake of lighter carbon isotopes. Similarly, the reduction of carbon can lead to an increase in the δ13C value, as the reduction process favors the uptake of heavier carbon isotopes.

##### Physical Factors

Physical factors, such as temperature and salinity, can also influence carbon isotope fractionation. Higher temperatures can lead to a decrease in the δ13C value, as the increased kinetic energy allows for more efficient uptake of lighter carbon isotopes. Similarly, higher salinity can lead to a decrease in the δ13C value, as the increased ionic strength can enhance the discrimination against heavier carbon isotopes.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these factors for the study of marine organic matter. We will also discuss how carbon isotope fractionation can be used to trace the sources and transformation of organic matter in the ocean.

#### 4.1c Case Studies of Carbon Isotope Fractionation

In this section, we will delve into some case studies that illustrate the application of carbon isotope fractionation in marine environments. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how the principles discussed in the previous sections are applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: Isotopic Fractionation in Marine Plankton

Marine plankton, which form the base of the marine food chain, are primary photosynthetic organisms. They preferentially absorb lighter carbon isotopes, leading to an enrichment of these isotopes in the organism relative to the surrounding environment. This can be quantified by the δ13C value, which is typically around -18‰ for marine plankton.

For instance, a study conducted in the Sargasso Sea found that the δ13C value of marine plankton ranged from -18.5‰ to -19.5‰. This study also found that the δ13C value of the plankton decreased with depth, reflecting the influence of physical factors such as temperature and salinity.

##### Case Study 2: Isotopic Fractionation in Marine Sediments

Marine sediments, which are the remains of organisms and their waste products, can also provide valuable insights into carbon isotope fractionation. These sediments can be analyzed to determine the δ13C value of the organic matter they contain.

For example, a study conducted in the Cariaco Basin found that the δ13C value of the sediments ranged from -20‰ to -25‰. This study also found that the δ13C value of the sediments decreased with depth, reflecting the influence of biological and chemical factors.

##### Case Study 3: Isotopic Fractionation in Marine Organic Matter

Marine organic matter, which is the organic component of marine sediments, can also be analyzed for carbon isotope fractionation. This can provide insights into the sources of the organic matter and the processes that have transformed it.

For instance, a study conducted in the North Atlantic found that the δ13C value of marine organic matter ranged from -20‰ to -25‰. This study also found that the δ13C value of the organic matter decreased with depth, reflecting the influence of biological, chemical, and physical factors.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the power of carbon isotope fractionation as a tool for studying marine environments. By analyzing the δ13C value of various components of the marine system, scientists can gain insights into the sources and transformation of organic matter, as well as the influence of biological, chemical, and physical factors.




### Section: 4.1 Carbon Isotope Fractionation in Marine Environments:

#### 4.1b Factors Influencing Carbon Isotope Fractionation

Carbon isotope fractionation in marine environments is influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, salinity, and the type of photosynthetic organisms present. These factors can significantly alter the δ13C value of organic matter, providing valuable insights into the sources and transformations of organic matter in the ocean.

#### Temperature

Temperature plays a crucial role in carbon isotope fractionation. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules also increases. This increased energy allows for more efficient uptake of lighter carbon isotopes during photosynthesis, leading to a decrease in the δ13C value of organic matter. This effect is particularly pronounced in marine environments, where temperature variations can be large and rapid.

#### Salinity

Salinity is another important factor influencing carbon isotope fractionation. Higher salinity can enhance the discrimination against heavier carbon isotopes during photosynthesis, leading to a decrease in the δ13C value of organic matter. This effect is thought to be due to the increased ionic strength of the seawater, which can alter the chemical environment of the photosynthetic organisms.

#### Type of Photosynthetic Organisms

The type of photosynthetic organisms present in a marine environment can also significantly influence carbon isotope fractionation. As mentioned earlier, C3 and C4 plants show a preference for lighter carbon isotopes, leading to a decrease in the δ13C value. Similarly, marine photosynthetic organisms, such as plankton, also show a preference for lighter carbon isotopes, resulting in a decrease in the δ13C value of marine organic matter.

In conclusion, carbon isotope fractionation in marine environments is a complex process influenced by a variety of factors. By studying these factors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the sources and transformations of organic matter in the ocean, and how these processes are influenced by environmental changes.

### Subsection: 4.2a Sample Collection and Preparation for Isotope Analysis

Stable carbon isotope analysis is a powerful tool for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments. However, the accuracy and reliability of the results heavily depend on the proper collection and preparation of the sample. In this section, we will discuss the various steps involved in sample collection and preparation for stable carbon isotope analysis.

#### Sample Collection

The first step in stable carbon isotope analysis is the collection of a representative sample. This involves selecting a location in the water column or sediment profile where the organic matter of interest is present. The sample should be collected using a sterile container to avoid contamination from external sources. The sample should also be collected in a way that minimizes disturbance to the surrounding environment.

#### Sample Preparation

Once the sample is collected, it needs to be prepared for analysis. This involves removing any inorganic matter, such as sand or rocks, from the sample. This can be done by passing the sample through a sieve or by manually picking out the inorganic matter. The sample should then be dried and ground to a fine powder.

#### Isotope Analysis

The prepared sample is then ready for isotope analysis. This involves measuring the ratio of stable carbon isotopes, typically carbon-12 and carbon-13, in the sample. This is typically done using a technique called mass spectrometry, which separates the different isotopes based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The results are then compared to known standards to determine the isotopic composition of the sample.

#### Interpretation of Results

The final step in stable carbon isotope analysis is the interpretation of the results. This involves comparing the isotopic composition of the sample to that of known sources of organic matter, such as terrestrial or marine plants. By identifying the source of the organic matter, we can gain insights into the origin and fate of the organic matter in the marine environment.

In conclusion, stable carbon isotope analysis is a powerful tool for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments. However, the accuracy and reliability of the results heavily depend on the proper collection and preparation of the sample. By following the steps outlined in this section, we can ensure that our results are accurate and meaningful.





### Subsection: 4.2b Analytical Techniques for Stable Carbon Isotopes

Stable carbon isotope analysis is a powerful tool for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments. However, the accuracy and reliability of the results heavily depend on the analytical techniques used. In this section, we will discuss the various analytical techniques used for stable carbon isotope analysis.

#### Mass Spectrometry

Mass spectrometry is the most commonly used technique for stable carbon isotope analysis. It involves ionizing the sample and separating the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The ions are then detected and their abundance is measured. The ratio of the abundance of carbon-13 to carbon-12 ions provides the isotopic composition of the sample.

#### Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS)

Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is a specialized form of mass spectrometry that is used for stable isotope analysis. It is particularly useful for analyzing the isotopic composition of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur. IRMS is capable of measuring isotopic compositions with high precision and accuracy, making it an essential tool for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments.

#### Combustion-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (C-IRMS)

Combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (C-IRMS) is a technique that is used to analyze the isotopic composition of carbon in organic compounds. The sample is first combusted to produce carbon dioxide, which is then introduced into the mass spectrometer. The ratio of the abundance of carbon-13 to carbon-12 ions in the carbon dioxide provides the isotopic composition of the sample. C-IRMS is particularly useful for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments, as it can provide information about the carbon sources and transformations that have occurred.

#### Gas Chromatography-Combustion-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS)

Gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) is a technique that combines gas chromatography and C-IRMS to analyze the isotopic composition of carbon in organic compounds. The sample is first separated into its individual components using gas chromatography, and then each component is combusted and introduced into the mass spectrometer. The isotopic composition of each component is then measured, providing information about the different sources and transformations that have occurred. GC-C-IRMS is particularly useful for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments, as it can provide information about the individual components of a sample.

#### Stable Isotope Ratio Monitoring (SIRM)

Stable isotope ratio monitoring (SIRM) is a technique that is used to continuously monitor the isotopic composition of carbon in a sample. The sample is continuously introduced into the mass spectrometer, and the isotopic composition is measured in real-time. SIRM is particularly useful for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments, as it can provide information about the changes in isotopic composition over time.

In conclusion, stable carbon isotope analysis is a powerful tool for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments. The choice of analytical technique depends on the specific research question and the type of sample being analyzed. By combining different techniques, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex processes that occur in marine environments.





### Subsection: 4.2c Data Interpretation and Limitations

Interpreting stable carbon isotope data can be a complex and challenging task, especially in marine environments where multiple sources and transformations of organic matter can occur. However, with the right techniques and understanding of the underlying principles, it can provide valuable insights into the origin and fate of organic matter.

#### Interpreting Stable Carbon Isotope Data

The interpretation of stable carbon isotope data involves comparing the measured isotopic composition of a sample to known standards. This can be done using various techniques, such as the δ notation, which expresses the isotopic composition as a deviation from a standard in parts per thousand (‰). The δ notation is particularly useful for comparing the isotopic composition of different samples.

Another important aspect of interpreting stable carbon isotope data is understanding the fractionation factors. Fractionation factors are the differences in the isotopic composition of different molecules or compounds. They can be used to estimate the isotopic composition of a sample based on its chemical composition. For example, the fractionation factor for carbon dioxide is 1.1%, meaning that carbon dioxide has a higher isotopic composition than carbon.

#### Limitations of Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis

While stable carbon isotope analysis is a powerful tool for studying the origin and fate of organic matter, it does have some limitations. One of the main limitations is the potential for contamination. As mentioned in the previous section, the use of different analytical techniques can introduce contamination, which can affect the accuracy of the results.

Another limitation is the potential for errors in the measurement of stable carbon isotopes. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as sample preparation, instrument calibration, and data processing. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential sources of error and take steps to minimize them.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, stable carbon isotope analysis is a valuable tool for studying the origin and fate of organic matter in marine environments. However, it is important to carefully consider the limitations and potential sources of error in order to accurately interpret the results. With the right techniques and understanding, stable carbon isotope data can provide valuable insights into the complex processes occurring in the marine environment.

However, the preservation and diagenesis of this carbon are complex processes that are influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of sediment, the presence of oxygen and other elements, and the temperature and pressure conditions of the marine environment.

In this section, we will explore the various factors that influence the preservation and diagenesis of organic carbon in marine sediments. We will also discuss the methods and techniques used to study these processes, including the use of advanced analytical techniques and computer models. By the end of this section, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the complex processes that govern the preservation and diagenesis of organic carbon in marine sediments.

#### 5.1a.1 Factors Influencing Organic Carbon Preservation

The preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments is influenced by a variety of factors. These include the type of sediment, the presence of oxygen and other elements, and the temperature and pressure conditions of the marine environment. 

Sediment type plays a significant role in organic carbon preservation. For instance, sediments with high organic matter content, such as black shales, are more likely to preserve organic carbon compared to sediments with lower organic matter content. This is because organic matter provides a protective environment for organic carbon, shielding it from oxidation and degradation.

The presence of oxygen and other elements also influences organic carbon preservation. Oxygen, for instance, can promote the oxidation of organic carbon, leading to its degradation and loss from the sediment. Similarly, the presence of certain elements, such as iron and sulphate, can also promote the oxidation of organic carbon.

Temperature and pressure conditions of the marine environment also play a crucial role in organic carbon preservation. High temperatures and pressures can promote the diagenesis of organic carbon, leading to its transformation into hydrocarbons. This process can enhance the preservation of organic carbon, as hydrocarbons are more resistant to oxidation and degradation compared to the original organic matter.

#### 5.1a.2 Methods and Techniques for Studying Organic Carbon Preservation

The study of organic carbon preservation involves the use of advanced analytical techniques and computer models. These include techniques for measuring the concentration of organic carbon in sediments, determining the composition of organic matter, and studying the diagenetic processes that transform organic carbon into hydrocarbons.

Analytical techniques used in the study of organic carbon preservation include spectroscopic methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which provide information about the structure and composition of organic matter. Other techniques include mass spectrometry, which can be used to identify specific compounds in organic matter, and radiochemical methods, which can be used to study the diagenetic processes that transform organic carbon into hydrocarbons.

Computer models are also used in the study of organic carbon preservation. These models can simulate the diagenetic processes that transform organic carbon into hydrocarbons, and can be used to predict the preservation of organic carbon in different types of sediments under different environmental conditions.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, providing a comprehensive guide to the study of organic carbon preservation in marine sediments.




### Subsection: 5.1b Biological, Chemical, and Physical Factors

The preservation and diagenesis of organic carbon in marine sediments are influenced by a complex interplay of biological, chemical, and physical factors. These factors interact in intricate ways to determine the fate of organic carbon in the sedimentary environment.

#### Biological Factors

Biological factors play a crucial role in the preservation of organic carbon. The type of organisms present in the water column and the sediment can significantly influence the amount and type of organic carbon that is produced and buried. For instance, the presence of photosynthetic organisms can increase the production of organic carbon through the process of photosynthesis. Additionally, the type of organisms present can also influence the type of organic carbon produced. For example, certain bacteria can produce hydrocarbons, which are more resistant to degradation and therefore more likely to be preserved.

#### Chemical Factors

Chemical factors also play a significant role in the preservation of organic carbon. The composition of the sediment, including the presence of certain elements and compounds, can influence the rate of organic carbon degradation. For instance, the presence of oxygen can increase the rate of organic carbon degradation, while the presence of certain elements, such as iron and sulfate, can inhibit degradation. Additionally, the pH of the sediment can also influence the preservation of organic carbon. A lower pH can increase the solubility of organic carbon, making it more likely to be preserved.

#### Physical Factors

Physical factors, such as temperature and pressure, can also influence the preservation of organic carbon. Higher temperatures can increase the rate of organic carbon degradation, while lower temperatures can slow down this process. Pressure can also influence the preservation of organic carbon, with higher pressures being more conducive to the preservation of organic carbon.

In conclusion, the preservation and diagenesis of organic carbon in marine sediments are influenced by a complex interplay of biological, chemical, and physical factors. Understanding these factors and how they interact is crucial for predicting the fate of organic carbon in the sedimentary environment.




### Subsection: 5.1c Case Studies in Organic Carbon Preservation

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the complex interplay of biological, chemical, and physical factors in the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments.

#### Case Study 1: The Selli Event

The Selli Event, also known as the OAE1a event, is a major marine organic carbon preservation event that occurred approximately 120 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. This event was characterized by a spike in marine productivity, likely driven by an increase in iron availability due to increased sulphate flux from volcanism. This increase in iron availability led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which in turn increased phosphorus availability, further stimulating marine productivity.

The Selli Event also saw a significant increase in the production of hydrocarbons, likely due to the anoxic conditions that prevailed during this time. The anoxic conditions inhibited the degradation of organic carbon, leading to its preservation in the sediment. This event serves as a clear example of how biological, chemical, and physical factors can interact to influence the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments.

#### Case Study 2: The Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2)

The Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) is another major marine organic carbon preservation event that occurred approximately 93 million years ago. This event was characterized by a spike in marine productivity, likely driven by an increase in iron availability due to increased sulphate flux from volcanism. However, unlike the Selli Event, the OAE2 event was not associated with a significant increase in hydrocarbon production.

Instead, the OAE2 event was characterized by a shift in the type of organic carbon produced. The increased iron availability led to an increase in the production of isotopically light organic carbon, likely due to the increased availability of hydrogen sulphide. This shift in organic carbon type is a clear example of how chemical factors can influence the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments.

#### Case Study 3: The Eocene Hyperthermal

The Eocene Hyperthermal, also known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), is a major marine organic carbon preservation event that occurred approximately 56 million years ago. This event was characterized by a spike in marine productivity, likely driven by an increase in iron availability due to increased sulphate flux from volcanism. However, unlike the Selli Event and the OAE2 event, the Eocene Hyperthermal was not associated with a significant increase in hydrocarbon production.

Instead, the Eocene Hyperthermal event was characterized by a shift in the type of organic carbon produced. The increased iron availability led to an increase in the production of isotopically light organic carbon, likely due to the increased availability of hydrogen sulphide. This shift in organic carbon type is a clear example of how chemical factors can influence the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments.

These case studies highlight the complex interplay of biological, chemical, and physical factors in the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments. They also underscore the importance of understanding these factors in predicting the preservation of organic carbon in the future.




### Subsection: 5.2a Introduction to Diagenesis

Diagenesis is a fundamental process in the evolution of sediments and sedimentary rocks. It refers to the physical, chemical, and biological changes that occur in sediments after deposition, but before lithification. These changes can significantly alter the composition and structure of the original sediments, and can have profound implications for the preservation and diagenesis of organic carbon.

#### 5.2a.1 Diagenetic Processes

Diagenesis is characterized by a variety of processes, including compaction, cementation, dissolution, and alteration of mineral and organic matter. These processes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, fluid chemistry, and biological activity.

Compaction is a common diagenetic process that occurs as sediments are buried and subjected to increasing pressure. This process can lead to the reduction of porosity and permeability, which can have significant implications for the preservation of organic carbon.

Cementation is another important diagenetic process. It involves the precipitation of minerals from pore fluids, which can fill the spaces between sediment grains and form new rocks. This process can enhance the mechanical strength of sediments, but can also lead to the loss of organic carbon if the cementing minerals react with the organic matter.

Dissolution is a process that involves the breakdown of minerals in sediments due to the action of fluids. This process can lead to the release of ions and other solutes, which can affect the composition of the sediments and the preservation of organic carbon.

Alteration of mineral and organic matter is a key aspect of diagenesis. This process involves changes in the chemical and mineral composition of sediments, which can be driven by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, fluid chemistry, and biological activity. These changes can significantly alter the preservation of organic carbon in sediments.

#### 5.2a.2 Diagenesis and Organic Carbon Preservation

Diagenesis plays a crucial role in the preservation of organic carbon in marine sediments. The processes of compaction, cementation, dissolution, and alteration of mineral and organic matter can all affect the preservation of organic carbon.

Compaction can reduce the porosity and permeability of sediments, which can limit the ability of organic matter to be preserved. However, compaction can also lead to the formation of anoxic conditions, which can enhance the preservation of organic carbon.

Cementation can enhance the mechanical strength of sediments, but can also lead to the loss of organic carbon if the cementing minerals react with the organic matter.

Dissolution can release ions and other solutes that can affect the composition of the sediments and the preservation of organic carbon.

Alteration of mineral and organic matter can significantly alter the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. This process can be driven by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, fluid chemistry, and biological activity.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into these diagenetic processes and their implications for the preservation and diagenesis of organic carbon in marine sediments.




### Subsection: 5.2b Major Diagenetic Processes

#### 5.2b.1 Compaction

Compaction is a fundamental diagenetic process that occurs as sediments are buried and subjected to increasing pressure. This process can lead to the reduction of porosity and permeability, which can have significant implications for the preservation of organic carbon.

Compaction is primarily driven by the weight of overlying sediments and the pressure they exert on the underlying sediments. As sediments are buried, they are subjected to increasing pressure, which causes them to compact and reduce in volume. This process can lead to the loss of pore space, which can reduce the ability of sediments to preserve organic carbon.

Compaction can also lead to the formation of sedimentary structures, such as folds and faults, which can further alter the preservation of organic carbon. These structures can disrupt the sedimentary fabric and create pathways for fluid flow, which can enhance the alteration of organic carbon.

#### 5.2b.2 Cementation

Cementation is another important diagenetic process. It involves the precipitation of minerals from pore fluids, which can fill the spaces between sediment grains and form new rocks. This process can enhance the mechanical strength of sediments, but can also lead to the loss of organic carbon if the cementing minerals react with the organic matter.

Cementation can be driven by a variety of factors, including changes in temperature and pressure, the composition of pore fluids, and biological activity. For example, the precipitation of carbonate minerals from seawater can enhance the preservation of organic carbon, as these minerals can form stable complexes with organic matter.

However, the precipitation of certain minerals, such as silica or iron oxides, can lead to the loss of organic carbon. These minerals can react with organic matter to form insoluble compounds, which can be removed from the sediments by fluid flow.

#### 5.2b.3 Dissolution

Dissolution is a process that involves the breakdown of minerals in sediments due to the action of fluids. This process can lead to the release of ions and other solutes, which can affect the composition of the sediments and the preservation of organic carbon.

Dissolution can be driven by a variety of factors, including changes in temperature and pressure, the composition of pore fluids, and biological activity. For example, the dissolution of carbonate minerals can lead to the release of carbonate ions, which can react with organic matter to form stable complexes.

However, the dissolution of certain minerals, such as silica or iron oxides, can lead to the loss of organic carbon. These minerals can react with organic matter to form insoluble compounds, which can be removed from the sediments by fluid flow.

#### 5.2b.4 Alteration of Mineral and Organic Matter

Alteration of mineral and organic matter is a key aspect of diagenesis. This process involves changes in the chemical and mineral composition of sediments, which can be driven by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, fluid chemistry, and biological activity.

Alteration can lead to the formation of new minerals, the transformation of existing minerals, and the degradation of organic matter. These changes can significantly alter the preservation of organic carbon.

For example, the alteration of iron oxides can lead to the formation of hematite, which can enhance the preservation of organic carbon. However, the alteration of organic matter can lead to the loss of organic carbon, as organic compounds can be degraded to form simpler molecules that are more soluble in fluids.

In conclusion, diagenesis plays a crucial role in the preservation and alteration of organic carbon in marine sediments. Understanding the major diagenetic processes, including compaction, cementation, dissolution, and alteration of mineral and organic matter, is essential for predicting the fate of organic carbon in sediments.




### Subsection: 5.2c Impact of Diagenesis on Organic Carbon

Diagenesis plays a crucial role in the preservation and alteration of organic carbon in marine sediments. The processes of compaction, cementation, and dissolution can significantly impact the amount and quality of organic carbon that is preserved in sediments.

#### 5.2c.1 Compaction and Organic Carbon Preservation

Compaction can have a profound impact on the preservation of organic carbon. As sediments are buried and subjected to increasing pressure, they can compact and reduce in volume, leading to a decrease in porosity and permeability. This reduction in pore space can limit the ability of sediments to preserve organic carbon, as it reduces the volume available for the burial and preservation of organic matter.

However, compaction can also lead to the formation of sedimentary structures, such as folds and faults, which can enhance the preservation of organic carbon. These structures can disrupt the sedimentary fabric and create pathways for fluid flow, which can enhance the alteration of organic carbon.

#### 5.2c.2 Cementation and Organic Carbon Alteration

Cementation is another important process that can impact the preservation of organic carbon. The precipitation of minerals from pore fluids can fill the spaces between sediment grains and form new rocks. This process can enhance the mechanical strength of sediments, but can also lead to the loss of organic carbon if the cementing minerals react with the organic matter.

Cementation can be driven by a variety of factors, including changes in temperature and pressure, the composition of pore fluids, and biological activity. For example, the precipitation of carbonate minerals from seawater can enhance the preservation of organic carbon, as these minerals can form stable complexes with organic matter. However, the precipitation of certain minerals, such as silica or iron oxides, can lead to the loss of organic carbon.

#### 5.2c.3 Dissolution and Organic Carbon Alteration

Dissolution is a process that can significantly alter the amount and quality of organic carbon in sediments. The dissolution of minerals can create voids in the sediment, which can increase porosity and permeability. This can enhance the preservation of organic carbon, as it increases the volume available for the burial and preservation of organic matter.

However, dissolution can also lead to the loss of organic carbon if the dissolved minerals react with the organic matter. For example, the dissolution of carbonate minerals can lead to the formation of bicarbonate ions, which can react with organic matter to form insoluble compounds. This can lead to the removal of organic carbon from the sediments.

In conclusion, diagenesis plays a crucial role in the preservation and alteration of organic carbon in marine sediments. The processes of compaction, cementation, and dissolution can significantly impact the amount and quality of organic carbon that is preserved in sediments. Understanding these processes is essential for understanding the long-term fate of organic carbon in the marine environment.

## Chapter 6: Hydrocarbons in Marine Sediments

 6.1: Hydrocarbon Types and Distribution

Hydrocarbons are an essential component of marine sediments, playing a crucial role in the geochemical processes occurring in the ocean. In this section, we will explore the different types of hydrocarbons found in marine sediments and their distribution.

#### 6.1a: Types of Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons can be classified into two main categories: petroleum and natural gas. Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons that includes aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as other compounds such as sulfur and nitrogen. Natural gas, on the other hand, is primarily composed of methane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, and butane.

Petroleum is further classified into three main types: crude oil, heavy oil, and extra-heavy oil. Crude oil is the most common type of petroleum and is typically found in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and limestone. It is a yellow to black liquid that is composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Heavy oil and extra-heavy oil are more viscous and are typically found in deeper, older sediments.

Natural gas is also classified into different types, depending on its composition. The most common type is methane, which is a colorless and odorless gas. Other types of natural gas include ethane, propane, and butane, which are commonly used as fuels.

In addition to petroleum and natural gas, marine sediments also contain various types of organic matter, including kerogen, bitumen, and humic substances. Kerogen is a solid, waxy substance that is found in sedimentary rocks and is the precursor to petroleum. Bitumen is a semi-solid, tar-like substance that is found in sedimentary rocks and is a major component of heavy oil and extra-heavy oil. Humic substances are complex mixtures of organic compounds that are found in sedimentary rocks and are a major component of kerogen.

The distribution of hydrocarbons in marine sediments is influenced by various factors, including the type of sediment, the age of the sediment, and the presence of microorganisms. In general, hydrocarbons are more abundant in younger sediments, as they are more recently formed through the process of biodegradation. Additionally, the type of sediment can also affect the distribution of hydrocarbons, with sandy sediments typically containing more hydrocarbons than muddy sediments.

The presence of microorganisms also plays a significant role in the distribution of hydrocarbons in marine sediments. Microorganisms, such as bacteria and archaea, are responsible for the biodegradation of organic matter, which leads to the formation of hydrocarbons. The type and abundance of microorganisms can vary depending on the type of sediment and the availability of nutrients, which can impact the distribution of hydrocarbons.

In conclusion, hydrocarbons are an essential component of marine sediments, and their distribution is influenced by various factors. Understanding the different types of hydrocarbons and their distribution is crucial for studying the geochemical processes occurring in the ocean and for the petroleum industry. In the next section, we will explore the role of hydrocarbons in the carbon cycle and their impact on climate change.

#### 6.1b: Distribution of Hydrocarbons

The distribution of hydrocarbons in marine sediments is also influenced by the presence of microorganisms. Microorganisms play a crucial role in the biodegradation of organic matter, which is the primary source of hydrocarbons in marine sediments. The type and abundance of microorganisms can vary depending on the type of sediment and the availability of nutrients.

In general, hydrocarbons are more abundant in sediments with high levels of organic matter. This is because organic matter is a major source of hydrocarbons, and sediments with high levels of organic matter are more likely to contain a diverse range of hydrocarbons. Additionally, the presence of microorganisms can also increase the distribution of hydrocarbons in sediments.

The distribution of hydrocarbons can also be affected by the type of sediment. Sandy sediments, for example, tend to have a higher distribution of hydrocarbons compared to muddy sediments. This is because sandy sediments have a larger surface area, allowing for more efficient biodegradation of organic matter and the formation of hydrocarbons.

In conclusion, the distribution of hydrocarbons in marine sediments is influenced by various factors, including the type of sediment, the age of the sediment, and the presence of microorganisms. Understanding the distribution of hydrocarbons is crucial for studying the geochemical processes occurring in the ocean and for the petroleum industry.

## Chapter 6: Hydrocarbons in Marine Sediments

 6.1: Hydrocarbon Types and Distribution

Hydrocarbons are an essential component of marine sediments, playing a crucial role in the geochemical processes occurring in the ocean. In this section, we will explore the different types of hydrocarbons found in marine sediments and their distribution.

#### 6.1a: Types of Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons can be classified into two main categories: petroleum and natural gas. Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons that includes aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as other compounds such as sulfur and nitrogen. Natural gas, on the other hand, is primarily composed of methane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, and butane.

Petroleum is further classified into three main types: crude oil, heavy oil, and extra-heavy oil. Crude oil is the most common type of petroleum and is typically found in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and limestone. It is a yellow to black liquid that is composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Heavy oil and extra-heavy oil are more viscous and are typically found in deeper, older sediments.

Natural gas is also classified into different types, depending on its composition. The most common type is methane, which is a colorless and odorless gas. Other types of natural gas include ethane, propane, and butane, which are commonly used as fuels.

In addition to petroleum and natural gas, marine sediments also contain various types of organic matter, including kerogen, bitumen, and humic substances. Kerogen is a solid, waxy substance that is found in sedimentary rocks and is the precursor to petroleum. Bitumen is a semi-solid, tar-like substance that is found in sedimentary rocks and is a major component of heavy oil and extra-heavy oil. Humic substances are complex mixtures of organic compounds that are found in sedimentary rocks and are a major component of kerogen.

The distribution of hydrocarbons in marine sediments is influenced by various factors, including the type of sediment, the age of the sediment, and the presence of microorganisms. In general, hydrocarbons are more abundant in younger sediments, as they are more recently formed through the process of biodegradation. Additionally, the type of sediment can also affect the distribution of hydrocarbons, with sandy sediments typically containing more hydrocarbons than muddy sediments.

#### 6.1b: Distribution of Hydrocarbons

The distribution of hydrocarbons in marine sediments is also influenced by the presence of microorganisms. Microorganisms play a crucial role in the biodegradation of organic matter, which is the primary source of hydrocarbons in marine sediments. The type and abundance of microorganisms can vary depending on the type of sediment and the availability of nutrients.

In general, hydrocarbons are more abundant in sediments with high levels of organic matter, as microorganisms are more likely to thrive in these environments. Additionally, the presence of specific microorganisms, such as methanogens, can also impact the distribution of hydrocarbons. Methanogens are responsible for the production of methane, which is a major component of natural gas. The presence of these microorganisms can lead to higher levels of methane in marine sediments.

The distribution of hydrocarbons can also be affected by the presence of hydrocarbon reservoirs. These reservoirs are geological structures that trap and store hydrocarbons, such as oil and gas. The distribution of these reservoirs can vary depending on the type of sediment and the geological history of the area.

In conclusion, the distribution of hydrocarbons in marine sediments is influenced by various factors, including the type of sediment, the presence of microorganisms, and the availability of nutrients. Understanding these factors is crucial for studying the distribution of hydrocarbons and their role in the geochemical processes occurring in the ocean.

### Introduction

Marine environments are vast and complex, teeming with a diverse array of life and organic matter. The cycling of particulate organic carbon (POC) in these environments is a crucial process that plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of POC cycling, exploring its various stages and the factors that influence it.

POC cycling is a multifaceted process that involves the production, transport, and degradation of organic carbon. It is a key component of the marine food web, with POC serving as the primary source of energy for a wide range of organisms. The cycling of POC also has significant implications for the global carbon cycle, as it influences the amount of carbon that is sequestered in the ocean and the amount that is released into the atmosphere.

In this chapter, we will explore the various stages of POC cycling, from its production in the surface waters to its transport to the deep sea and its eventual degradation. We will also discuss the factors that influence each stage of the cycle, including biological activity, physical processes, and chemical reactions.

Understanding the cycling of POC is not only important for marine biologists and geochemists, but also for climate scientists. Changes in the cycling of POC can have significant impacts on the Earth's climate, and studying this process can provide valuable insights into the future of our planet.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the topic, exploring the various aspects of POC cycling in marine environments. We will also discuss the current state of research in this field and the future directions for study. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the cycling of particulate organic carbon in marine environments.




#### 6.1a Introduction to Particulate Organic Carbon

Particulate organic carbon (POC) is a critical component of the marine ecosystem. It is the organic matter that is suspended in the water column, and it plays a pivotal role in the cycling of carbon in the ocean. POC is produced by marine organisms, including phytoplnts, zooplankton, and other organisms. It is then transported through the water column, where it undergoes various processes of degradation and transformation.

The production of POC is primarily driven by photosynthesis. Marine phytoplankton, which are microscopic organisms that live in the surface waters of the ocean, use sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce organic matter. This process is known as primary production, and it is the foundation of the marine food web. The POC produced by phytoplankton serves as the primary source of energy for a wide range of organisms, including zooplankton, fish, and larger marine mammals.

Once produced, POC can be transported to different depths in the water column. This transport is primarily driven by physical processes, including turbulence and currents. POC can also be transported horizontally, across the ocean basins, by ocean currents. The transport of POC is a crucial step in the cycling of carbon in the ocean. It allows carbon to be distributed throughout the water column, and it can also transport carbon to the deep sea, where it can be sequestered for long periods of time.

The degradation of POC is a complex process that involves a variety of biological, chemical, and physical processes. POC can be degraded by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. These organisms use POC as a source of energy and carbon, and they play a crucial role in the cycling of carbon in the ocean. The degradation of POC can also be influenced by chemical reactions, including oxidation and reduction reactions. Physical processes, such as sedimentation and advection, can also influence the degradation of POC.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the production, transport, and degradation of POC. We will also explore the various factors that influence these processes, including biological activity, physical processes, and chemical reactions. Understanding the cycling of POC is not only important for marine biologists and geochemists, but also for climate scientists. Changes in the cycling of POC can have significant impacts on the Earth's climate, and studying this process can provide valuable insights into the future of our planet.

#### 6.1b Fate of Particulate Organic Carbon

The fate of particulate organic carbon (POC) in marine environments is a complex and dynamic process. Once produced, POC can undergo a variety of transformations and transfers, influencing its distribution and impact on the marine ecosystem.

##### Sinking and Burial

One of the primary fates of POC is its sinking and burial in the deep sea. As POC descends through the water column, it can become incorporated into sediments, where it can remain for long periods of time. This process is particularly important in the deep sea, where the slow sedimentation rates allow for the accumulation of large quantities of POC. The burial of POC in sediments can have significant implications for the global carbon cycle. By removing POC from the surface waters, this process can help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, contributing to the mitigation of climate change.

##### Remineralization

Another important fate of POC is its remineralization. This process involves the breakdown of POC by microorganisms, releasing nutrients and carbon back into the water column. Remineralization can occur at any depth in the water column, but it is particularly prevalent in the deep sea, where the slow sedimentation rates allow for the accumulation of large quantities of POC. The remineralization of POC can have significant implications for the marine ecosystem. By releasing nutrients back into the water column, this process can stimulate primary production, supporting the growth of marine organisms and the food web.

##### Vertical Transfer

POC can also undergo vertical transfer, moving between different depths in the water column. This process can occur through various mechanisms, including advection, diffusion, and turbulence. Vertical transfer can have significant implications for the distribution of POC in the ocean. By moving POC between different depths, this process can help to balance the carbon budget in the ocean, redistributing carbon from areas of high productivity to areas of low productivity.

In conclusion, the fate of POC in marine environments is a complex and dynamic process, influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change on the marine ecosystem, and for developing strategies to mitigate these impacts.

#### 6.1c Case Studies of Particulate Organic Carbon Production and Fate

To further illustrate the complex and dynamic nature of particulate organic carbon (POC) cycling in marine environments, let's examine two case studies: the Selli Event and the modern ocean.

##### The Selli Event

The Selli Event, a period of intense marine productivity, occurred approximately 120 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. This event was characterized by a spike in marine productivity, likely driven by an increase in iron availability due to increased sulphate flux from volcanism[^1^]. The increased iron availability led to an increase in phytoplankton productivity, which in turn increased the production of POC.

The fate of this POC was largely determined by the geochemical conditions of the time. The increased iron availability also led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which inhibits the sinking of POC[^1^]. This resulted in a decrease in the burial of POC in sediments. However, the increased POC production also led to an increase in remineralization, as the POC was broken down by microorganisms and the nutrients were released back into the water column.

##### Modern Ocean

In contrast to the Selli Event, the modern ocean is characterized by a more balanced POC cycling system. The modern ocean is also characterized by a more complex and dynamic POC cycling system, with various factors influencing the production and fate of POC.

For instance, the modern ocean is characterized by a complex interplay between physical and biological processes. Physical processes, such as turbulence and advection, can influence the vertical distribution of POC, while biological processes, such as primary production and remineralization, can influence the amount of POC in the water column.

The modern ocean is also characterized by a more balanced carbon budget, with POC production and burial largely offsetting POC remineralization. This balance is largely maintained by the efficient transport of POC from the surface waters to the deep sea, where it can be buried in sediments.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the complex and dynamic nature of POC cycling in marine environments. They also underscore the importance of understanding the various factors that influence the production and fate of POC, as this knowledge can help us predict the impacts of climate change on the marine ecosystem.

#### 6.1b Production and Transformation of POC

The production of particulate organic carbon (POC) is a complex process that involves a variety of biological, chemical, and physical factors. As discussed in the previous section, primary production by marine phytoplankton is the primary source of POC. However, the transformation of POC is equally important and involves a series of processes that can alter its chemical composition and fate in the ocean.

#### 6.1b.1 Transformation of POC

The transformation of POC can occur through several pathways, including degradation, sedimentation, and sinking. Degradation is the process by which POC is broken down by microorganisms into simpler compounds. This process is primarily driven by the activity of bacteria and archaea, which use POC as a source of energy and carbon. The rate of degradation can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the POC, the presence of specific microorganisms, and environmental conditions such as temperature and oxygen availability.

Sedimentation and sinking are physical processes that can transport POC to different depths in the water column. Sedimentation occurs when POC particles settle due to gravity, while sinking involves the movement of POC particles through the water column due to density differences. These processes can transport POC to the deep sea, where it can be sequestered for long periods of time.

#### 6.1b.2 Fate of POC

The fate of POC in the ocean is largely determined by its transformation processes. Degraded POC can be remineralized, meaning it is converted back into inorganic carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. This process can contribute to the ocean's carbon pool and help to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Sedimented and sunken POC can also contribute to the formation of sedimentary rocks. Over long periods of time, POC can be buried under layers of sediment and undergo diagenesis, a process by which organic matter is transformed into solid rock. This process can remove large amounts of carbon from the ocean and store it in the Earth's crust.

In conclusion, the production and transformation of POC are crucial processes in the cycling of carbon in the ocean. They play a significant role in the ocean's carbon pool and have important implications for climate change and the Earth's carbon cycle. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting the future of our oceans and the planet as a whole.

#### 6.1c POC in Marine Ecosystems

Particulate organic carbon (POC) plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, serving as a primary source of energy and carbon for a wide range of organisms. The distribution and cycling of POC in the ocean are influenced by a variety of factors, including primary production, degradation, sedimentation, and sinking.

#### 6.1c.1 Distribution of POC in Marine Ecosystems

The distribution of POC in marine ecosystems is largely determined by primary production. Marine phytoplankton, which are responsible for the majority of primary production in the ocean, produce POC as a byproduct of photosynthesis. This POC is then consumed by a variety of organisms, including zooplankton, fish, and larger marine mammals.

The distribution of POC can also be influenced by the transformation processes of degradation, sedimentation, and sinking. For example, POC that is degraded in the surface waters of the ocean can be remineralized, contributing to the ocean's carbon pool. Similarly, POC that is sedimented or sunken can be transported to different depths in the water column, altering its distribution.

#### 6.1c.2 Cycling of POC in Marine Ecosystems

The cycling of POC in marine ecosystems is a complex process that involves a series of interconnected pathways. Primary production is the primary source of POC, while degradation, sedimentation, and sinking are the primary pathways for its transformation.

The cycling of POC can also involve the exchange of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere. For example, POC that is degraded in the surface waters of the ocean can be converted into carbon dioxide, which can then be released into the atmosphere. Conversely, POC that is sedimented or sunken can be buried under layers of sediment, where it can be stored for long periods of time.

#### 6.1c.3 POC and Climate Change

The cycling of POC in marine ecosystems has important implications for climate change. The degradation of POC can contribute to the ocean's carbon pool, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Similarly, the burial of POC under layers of sediment can remove large amounts of carbon from the ocean, potentially reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

However, the cycling of POC can also have negative impacts on climate change. For example, the release of carbon dioxide from the degradation of POC can contribute to the warming of the ocean and the atmosphere. Similarly, the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the degradation of POC can also contribute to climate change.

In conclusion, POC plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, serving as a primary source of energy and carbon for a wide range of organisms. Its distribution and cycling are influenced by a variety of factors, including primary production, degradation, sedimentation, and sinking. Understanding the role of POC in marine ecosystems is essential for predicting the future of our oceans and the planet as a whole.




#### 6.1c Fate and Transport of POC

The fate and transport of particulate organic carbon (POC) in marine environments is a complex process that involves a series of physical, chemical, and biological interactions. As discussed in the previous sections, POC can be produced by marine phytoplankton, transformed through degradation, sedimentation, and sinking, and eventually remineralized or buried in sedimentary rocks. However, the exact pathways and mechanisms of POC transport are still not fully understood.

#### 6.1c.1 Transport of POC

The transport of POC in marine environments is primarily driven by ocean currents and wind. Ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current, can transport POC over long distances. Wind can also play a significant role in the transport of POC, particularly in the surface waters where it can drive the movement of POC particles through the water column.

In addition to physical transport, biological processes can also play a role in the transport of POC. For example, the sinking of POC particles can be influenced by the activity of zooplankton, which can consume and transport POC particles to different depths in the water column. Furthermore, the degradation of POC can be influenced by the presence of specific microorganisms, which can alter the chemical composition of POC and potentially affect its transport.

#### 6.1c.2 Fate of POC

The fate of POC in marine environments is largely determined by its transport pathways. POC that is transported to the deep sea can be sequestered for long periods of time, potentially contributing to the long-term storage of carbon in the ocean. However, POC can also be remineralized in the deep sea, converting it back into inorganic carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide and bicarbonate.

POC that is transported to the coast can also have a significant impact on coastal ecosystems. For example, the transport of POC to coastal sediments can contribute to the formation of sedimentary rocks, which can have important implications for the geological history of the Earth. Furthermore, the transport of POC to coastal waters can also influence the productivity of coastal ecosystems, as POC can serve as a source of energy and nutrients for marine organisms.

In conclusion, the fate and transport of POC in marine environments is a complex process that involves a series of physical, chemical, and biological interactions. Further research is needed to fully understand these processes and their implications for the marine environment.

The size of POC particles can also influence their interactions with other particles and organisms in the marine environment. For example, larger particles can be more easily detected and consumed by larger organisms, such as zooplankton and fish. This can have important implications for the food web and the transfer of carbon from primary producers to higher trophic levels.

Furthermore, the size of POC particles can also influence their interactions with other particles, such as aggregates and flocs. Larger particles can be incorporated into these aggregates, potentially altering their sinking rates and fate.

#### 6.2a.3 Potential for Burial or Remineralization

The size of POC particles can also affect their potential for burial or remineralization. Larger particles, due to their size and weight, can potentially settle out of the water column and be buried in sedimentary rocks. This can contribute to the long-term storage of carbon in the ocean.

On the other hand, smaller particles can be remineralized in the water column, converting them back into inorganic carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. The rate of remineralization can be influenced by the size of the particles, with smaller particles potentially remineralizing more rapidly than larger particles.

In conclusion, the size of POC particles plays a crucial role in their cycling and fate in marine environments. Understanding the factors that influence particle size is therefore essential for understanding the broader dynamics of POC cycling in the ocean.

### Subsection: 7.1a Major Sources of Terrestrial Organic Carbon

Terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments originate from a variety of sources, each with its own unique composition and transport mechanisms. In this section, we will explore the major sources of terrestrial organic carbon and their contributions to the marine environment.

#### Riverine Inputs

Rivers are a significant source of terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments. They transport large quantities of sediment and organic matter from the land to the sea, contributing to the overall productivity of marine ecosystems. The composition of riverine inputs is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of vegetation cover in the catchment area, the climate of the region, and human activities such as deforestation and agriculture.

For example, in the Amazon Basin, the dominant vegetation type is tropical rainforest, which produces a high amount of organic matter. This organic matter is transported to the sea via the Amazon River, contributing to the high productivity of the Amazon shelf. In contrast, in the Arctic regions, the dominant vegetation type is tundra, which produces less organic matter due to the short growing season. As a result, riverine inputs from these regions are lower in organic carbon content.

#### Atmospheric Inputs

Atmospheric inputs of terrestrial organic carbon occur through the deposition of dust and other particulate matter. These inputs are influenced by wind patterns and can originate from a variety of sources, including deserts, agricultural fields, and urban areas. The composition of atmospheric inputs is highly variable and can be influenced by human activities such as deforestation and agriculture.

For example, in the Sahara Desert, wind erosion of the sandy soil produces large quantities of dust, which is transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean and West Africa. This dust not only contributes to the sediment load of these regions but also introduces terrestrial organic carbon into the marine environment. Similarly, in agricultural areas, the use of fertilizers and pesticides can lead to the atmospheric deposition of these compounds, which can also contribute to the terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments.

#### Direct Inputs from the Land Surface

Direct inputs from the land surface occur through the deposition of sediment and organic matter from erosion and landslides. These inputs are influenced by factors such as topography, climate, and human activities such as deforestation and construction. The composition of direct inputs is highly variable and can be influenced by the type of vegetation cover in the area, the type of soil, and the presence of human-made materials.

For example, in mountainous regions, landslides can introduce large quantities of sediment and organic matter into the marine environment. These inputs can be particularly high in organic carbon content if the landslide occurs in an area with high vegetation cover. Similarly, in urban areas, construction activities can introduce large quantities of sediment and organic matter from demolished buildings, which can also contribute to the terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments.

In conclusion, terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments originate from a variety of sources, each with its own unique composition and transport mechanisms. Understanding these sources and their contributions is crucial for predicting changes in the marine environment due to climate change and other anthropogenic activities.




### Subsection: 7.1b Composition of Terrestrial Organic Carbon

The composition of terrestrial organic carbon is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of vegetation cover in the catchment area, the climate of the region, and human activities such as deforestation and agriculture. In this section, we will explore the composition of terrestrial organic carbon and its implications for marine sediments.

#### Vegetation Influence

The type of vegetation cover in a catchment area plays a significant role in the composition of terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments. For example, in the Amazon Basin, the dominant vegetation type is tropical rainforest, which produces a high amount of organic matter. This organic matter is transported to the sea via the Amazon River, contributing to the high productivity of the Amazon shelf. In contrast, in the Arctic regions, the dominant vegetation type is tundra, which produces less organic matter due to the short growing season. As a result, riverine inputs from these regions are lower in organic carbon content.

#### Climate Influence

The climate of a region also plays a crucial role in the composition of terrestrial organic carbon inputs. In warmer climates, such as the Amazon Basin, the high temperatures and precipitation rates promote rapid plant growth, resulting in a high production of organic matter. This organic matter is then transported to the sea via rivers, contributing to the high productivity of marine ecosystems. In contrast, in colder climates, such as the Arctic regions, the low temperatures and precipitation rates limit plant growth, resulting in lower production of organic matter. As a result, riverine inputs from these regions are lower in organic carbon content.

#### Human Influence

Human activities, such as deforestation and agriculture, can also significantly impact the composition of terrestrial organic carbon inputs. Deforestation, for example, reduces the amount of organic matter produced by vegetation, leading to a decrease in riverine inputs of organic carbon. Similarly, agricultural practices, such as the use of fertilizers and pesticides, can alter the composition of organic matter produced by plants, affecting the quality of terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments.

In conclusion, the composition of terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments is influenced by a variety of factors, including vegetation cover, climate, and human activities. Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting the impact of terrestrial organic carbon on marine ecosystems and for developing strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change on these ecosystems.





### Subsection: 7.1c Impact of Terrestrial Organic Carbon on Marine Sediments

The impact of terrestrial organic carbon on marine sediments is significant and multifaceted. The composition of terrestrial organic carbon, as discussed in the previous section, plays a crucial role in determining the productivity of marine ecosystems. However, the impact of terrestrial organic carbon on marine sediments goes beyond just productivity.

#### Nutrient Cycling

Terrestrial organic carbon inputs to marine sediments play a crucial role in nutrient cycling. As mentioned earlier, the Amazon River, with its high organic carbon content, contributes to the high productivity of the Amazon shelf. This high productivity is not only due to the availability of light but also the nutrients brought in by the river. The organic matter from the Amazon River is rich in nutrients, which are released into the water column when the organic matter decomposes. This nutrient-rich water then supports the growth of marine organisms, further contributing to the productivity of the region.

#### Sedimentation

Terrestrial organic carbon also plays a significant role in sedimentation. The organic matter from terrestrial sources, such as leaves and wood, can accumulate in the sediments, contributing to the formation of sedimentary rocks. This process is particularly important in the Amazon Basin, where the high sedimentation rates are due to the large amount of organic matter transported by the Amazon River. The sedimentation of terrestrial organic carbon can also have implications for the geological record, as it can provide insights into past vegetation cover and climate conditions.

#### Climate Change

The impact of terrestrial organic carbon on marine sediments is also significant in the context of climate change. As mentioned earlier, the Amazon River contributes to the high productivity of the Amazon shelf, which is also known as the "Amazonian marine hotspot." This high productivity is due to the high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which promotes plant growth. However, the Amazonian marine hotspot is also sensitive to climate change, as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect the productivity of the region. Therefore, understanding the impact of terrestrial organic carbon on marine sediments is crucial for predicting the future of marine ecosystems under climate change.

In conclusion, the impact of terrestrial organic carbon on marine sediments is multifaceted and has implications for productivity, nutrient cycling, sedimentation, and climate change. Further research is needed to fully understand these impacts and their implications for the future of marine ecosystems.

## Chapter 8: Marine Organic Carbon Reservoirs and Fluxes

### Introduction

The marine environment is a vast and complex system, teeming with life and playing a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Marine organic carbon reservoirs and fluxes are integral components of this system, acting as the primary source of carbon for marine organisms and contributing significantly to the overall carbon sequestration. This chapter, "Marine Organic Carbon Reservoirs and Fluxes," aims to delve into the intricacies of these reservoirs and the fluxes that govern their behavior.

Marine organic carbon reservoirs refer to the various forms of carbon that are stored in the marine environment, including dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and sedimentary organic carbon. These reservoirs are constantly replenished through various processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition, and their size and composition can provide valuable insights into the health and productivity of the marine ecosystem.

Fluxes, on the other hand, are the rates at which carbon is transferred between these reservoirs. They are influenced by a multitude of factors, including temperature, salinity, pH, and biological activity. Understanding these fluxes is crucial for predicting the future of our oceans in the face of climate change and other anthropogenic pressures.

In this chapter, we will explore the various types of marine organic carbon reservoirs, the processes that govern their fluxes, and the implications of these reservoirs and fluxes for the marine ecosystem and the global carbon cycle. We will also discuss the current state of research in this field and the future directions for study.

As we navigate through this chapter, it is our hope that you will gain a deeper understanding of the role of marine organic carbon reservoirs and fluxes in the marine environment and their importance for the health of our planet.




### Subsection: 7.2a Introduction to Riverine Transport

Rivers are a significant pathway for the transport of terrestrial organic carbon to the marine environment. The Amazon River, with its vast drainage basin and high sedimentation rates, is a prime example of this. The river's sediment transport is primarily driven by the river's flow, which is influenced by factors such as precipitation, evaporation, and the river's topography.

#### Riverine Sediment Transport

The transport of sediment in rivers is a complex process that involves the interaction of various physical and chemical factors. The sediment transport capacity of a river is determined by its flow rate, which is influenced by factors such as precipitation, evaporation, and the river's topography. For instance, the Amazon River, with its high flow rate and sediment transport capacity, is able to transport large amounts of sediment, including terrestrial organic carbon, to the marine environment.

The sediment transport capacity of a river can be quantified using various methods, such as the sediment transport equation. This equation takes into account factors such as the river's flow rate, sediment concentration, and the sediment's size and density. For example, the sediment transport equation for a river can be written as:

$$

### Subsection: 7.2c Impact of Riverine Transport on Marine Sediments

The transport of terrestrial organic carbon to marine sediments is a crucial process in the global carbon cycle. This process is primarily driven by riverine transport, which involves the movement of sediment and organic matter from land to the sea. The impact of riverine transport on marine sediments is multifaceted and has significant implications for the marine environment.

#### Riverine Transport and Marine Sediment Composition

Riverine transport plays a significant role in determining the composition of marine sediments. The sediment transported by rivers is a mixture of terrestrial and marine materials, including organic matter, minerals, and nutrients. The composition of this sediment can vary significantly depending on the source of the river, its catchment area, and the geological and climatic conditions in the region.

For instance, rivers draining from areas with high levels of organic matter, such as tropical rainforests, tend to transport more organic matter to the sea. This can lead to an increase in the organic carbon content of marine sediments, which can have significant implications for the marine ecosystem.

#### Riverine Transport and Marine Productivity

The transport of terrestrial organic carbon to marine sediments can also have a direct impact on marine productivity. As seen in the Selli Event, an increase in iron availability, driven by an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, can lead to a spike in marine productivity. This increase in productivity can have cascading effects on the marine ecosystem, leading to changes in species composition and diversity.

#### Riverine Transport and Ocean Acidification

However, the transport of terrestrial organic carbon to marine sediments can also have negative impacts. The large-scale volcanic release of carbon dioxide, as seen in the Selli Event, can lead to ocean acidification. This occurs when excess carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean and dissolved as carbonic acid, reducing the pH of seawater and causing a decrease in carbonate saturation. This can have significant implications for marine organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for shell formation.

#### Riverine Transport and Climate Change

The transport of terrestrial organic carbon to marine sediments can also have implications for climate change. As seen in the Selli Event, the large-scale volcanic release of carbon dioxide led to a spike in global temperatures. This was mitigated by an increase in silicate weathering, which helped to cool the Earth back to its pre-OAE1a state. However, the long-term effects of increased riverine transport of terrestrial organic carbon on climate change are still not fully understood and require further research.

In conclusion, the impact of riverine transport on marine sediments is complex and multifaceted. It can have significant implications for the marine ecosystem, including changes in sediment composition, marine productivity, ocean acidification, and climate change. Further research is needed to fully understand these impacts and their implications for the future of our planet.

### Introduction

Radiocarbon dating is a powerful tool in the field of marine organic geochemistry, providing a means to determine the age of organic materials with high precision. This chapter will delve into the various techniques and applications of radiocarbon dating in organic materials, with a focus on its relevance in the marine environment.

Radiocarbon dating, also known as carbon-14 dating, is a method of estimating the age of organic materials by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, contained within the sample. The technique is based on the principle that carbon-14 is constantly being created in the atmosphere by cosmic radiation and is incorporated into living organisms through photosynthesis. Once an organism dies, it stops exchanging carbon with the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon-14 in its tissues begins to decrease as it decays back to nitrogen-14.

In the marine environment, radiocarbon dating is particularly useful due to the abundance of organic materials, such as marine sediments and biota, which can provide valuable insights into past ocean conditions and climate changes. By dating these materials, scientists can reconstruct the history of the marine ecosystem, including the timing of major events such as the onset of anoxia or the arrival of new species.

This chapter will cover the principles of radiocarbon dating, including the physics behind carbon-14 decay and the mathematical models used to interpret radiocarbon data. It will also discuss the various techniques used to measure carbon-14, such as accelerator mass spectrometry and liquid scintillation counting. Furthermore, the chapter will explore the applications of radiocarbon dating in marine organic geochemistry, including its use in studying the age of sediments, the timing of marine events, and the reconstruction of past ocean conditions.

In conclusion, radiocarbon dating is a powerful tool in the field of marine organic geochemistry, providing a means to understand the history of the marine ecosystem. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to radiocarbon dating techniques, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to apply these techniques in their own research.




### Section: 9.1 Principles and Applications of Radiocarbon Dating

#### 9.1a Basics of Radiocarbon Dating

Radiocarbon dating is a method of estimating the age of organic materials by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, contained within the sample. The technique is based on the principle that carbon-14 is constantly being created in the atmosphere by cosmic radiation and is incorporated into living organisms through photosynthesis. Once an organism dies, it stops exchanging carbon with the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon-14 in its tissues begins to decrease as it decays back to nitrogen-14.

The process of radiocarbon dating involves measuring the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a sample. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is formed in the atmosphere by cosmic radiation. It is incorporated into living organisms through photosynthesis and is then passed on to the organisms that consume these plants. When an organism dies, it stops exchanging carbon with the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon-14 in its tissues begins to decrease as it decays back to nitrogen-14.

The rate at which carbon-14 decays back to nitrogen-14 is known as the half-life, which is approximately 5,730 years. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 in a sample and comparing it to the known half-life, scientists can estimate the age of the sample. This process is known as radiocarbon dating.

Radiocarbon dating has a wide range of applications in marine organic geochemistry. It is particularly useful in studying the age of sediments, the timing of marine events, and the reconstruction of past ocean conditions. By dating these materials, scientists can reconstruct the history of the marine ecosystem, including the timing of major events such as the onset of anoxia or the arrival of new species.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of radiocarbon dating, including the physics behind carbon-14 decay and the mathematical models used to interpret radiocarbon data. We will also discuss the various techniques used to measure carbon-14, such as accelerator mass spectrometry and liquid scintillation counting.

#### 9.1b Radiocarbon Dating Techniques

Radiocarbon dating techniques have evolved significantly over the years, with the development of new methods and technologies. These techniques are used to measure the amount of carbon-14 in a sample and to determine its age. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used radiocarbon dating techniques.

##### Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)

Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) is a technique used to measure the amount of carbon-14 in a sample. It is a highly sensitive method that can detect very small amounts of carbon-14. The AMS technique involves accelerating ions of carbon-14 and carbon-12 to high energies and then separating them based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The amount of carbon-14 is then determined by comparing the intensity of the carbon-14 ions to the intensity of the carbon-12 ions.

##### Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC)

Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC) is another technique used to measure the amount of carbon-14 in a sample. It involves mixing the sample with a liquid scintillator, which is a solution that emits light when excited by beta particles. The amount of light emitted is then measured, and this is used to determine the amount of carbon-14 in the sample.

Radiocarbon dating has been widely used in marine environments to study the age of sediments, the timing of marine events, and the reconstruction of past ocean conditions. This section will delve deeper into the specific applications of radiocarbon dating in marine environments.

#### 9.1b.1 Age Determination of Marine Sediments

Radiocarbon dating is a powerful tool for determining the age of marine sediments. The technique is particularly useful for sediments that contain organic matter, such as sediments from the Bimini Road. By dating the shells and cement that make up the Bimini Road, scientists have been able to determine the age of this feature.

The radiocarbon dates from the shells composing the beachrock core from the Bimini Road indicate that the shells are about 3,500 years old, uncorrected for temporal and environmental variations in radiocarbon. This is consistent with the interpretation that the shells were cemented to form beachrock about 2,800 radiocarbon years ago. This is a significant finding, as it provides a clear timeline for the formation of the Bimini Road.

#### 9.1b.2 Timing of Marine Events

Radiocarbon dating can also be used to determine the timing of marine events. For example, the radiocarbon dates from the Bimini Road have provided insights into the timing of the final accumulation of shells and their subsequent cementation.

### Section: 9.1c Limitations of Radiocarbon Dating

While radiocarbon dating is a powerful tool for studying the age of marine sediments and events, it is not without its limitations. Understanding these limitations is crucial for interpreting radiocarbon dates and avoiding potential errors.

#### 9.1c.1 Age Range

The age range of radiocarbon dating is limited to approximately the last 50,000 years. This is because the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has varied over time, and the method assumes that the amount of carbon-14 in the sample is the same as the amount in the atmosphere at the time the sample was formed. Before 50,000 years ago, the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere was significantly higher, and the method becomes less accurate.

#### 9.1c.2 Contamination

Radiocarbon dating is susceptible to contamination. Any addition of carbon to a sample of a different age can result in an incorrect date. This can occur, for example, if a sample is exposed to modern carbon during collection or analysis. To mitigate this risk, strict protocols are in place for sample collection and handling.

#### 9.1c.3 Old Carbon Problem

The "old carbon" problem refers to the issue of dating sediments that contain carbon-14-deficient carbon. This can occur when sediments are mixed with older carbon from the surrounding environment, leading to an overestimation of the sample's age. This problem can be particularly significant in marine environments, where sediments can be easily mixed with older carbon from the seafloor.

#### 9.1c.4 Assumptions

Radiocarbon dating relies on several assumptions, including that the amount of carbon-14 in the sample is the same as the amount in the atmosphere at the time the sample was formed, and that the rate of carbon-14 production in the atmosphere has been constant over time. If these assumptions are not met, the resulting date may be inaccurate.

Despite these limitations, radiocarbon dating remains a valuable tool for studying the age of marine sediments and events. By understanding and accounting for these limitations, researchers can obtain reliable and meaningful radiocarbon dates.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of radiocarbon dating techniques in organic materials. We have explored the principles behind radiocarbon dating, its applications, and the limitations and challenges that come with it.

This lack of oxygen creates anoxic conditions, which are ideal for the growth and activity of anaerobic microorganisms. These organisms are able to thrive in these conditions due to their unique metabolic pathways, which allow them to obtain energy and nutrients from a variety of organic compounds.

One of the most common forms of anaerobic metabolism in marine sediments is fermentation. This process involves the breakdown of organic compounds, such as sugars and amino acids, to simpler substances, such as lactic acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen gas. This process is carried out by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea, and is crucial for the cycling of organic matter in these sediments.

Another important aspect of anaerobic metabolism in marine sediments is anaerobic respiration. This process involves the transfer of electrons from organic compounds to inorganic compounds, often resulting in the production of energy. Anaerobic respiration is carried out by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea, and is crucial for the cycling of nutrients in these sediments.

These communities are composed of a diverse array of bacteria and archaea, each with their own unique metabolic capabilities. The interactions between these microorganisms and their environment are crucial for the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in these sediments.

One of the key players in anaerobic metabolism is the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis. This organism is capable of utilizing a variety of substrates for energy production, including hydrogen gas, formate, and methylamines. Its genome contains a number of genes that are involved in the metabolism of these substrates, including the hydrogenase gene hdrABC, the formate hydrogenlyase gene fhlA, and the methylamine dehydrogenase gene mxaF.

The hydrogenase gene hdrABC is of particular interest, as it is involved in the production of hydrogen gas. This process, known as hydrogen evolution, is a key aspect of anaerobic metabolism in marine sediments. The production of hydrogen gas by M. maripaludis can be stimulated by the addition of formate or methylamine, indicating that these substrates can serve as electron donors for hydrogen evolution.

The formate hydrogenlyase gene fhlA is also important for anaerobic metabolism. This gene is involved in the production of formate, which can serve as an electron acceptor for hydrogen evolution. The presence of this gene suggests that M. maripaludis can utilize formate as a terminal electron acceptor, a process that is crucial for the cycling of nutrients in anoxic sediments.

The methylamine dehydrogenase gene mxaF is another key component of anaerobic metabolism. This gene is involved in the oxidation of methylamines, which can serve as electron donors for hydrogen evolution. The presence of this gene suggests that M. maripaludis can utilize methylamines as a source of energy, further expanding its metabolic capabilities.

In addition to these genes, the genome of M. maripaludis also contains a number of other genes that are involved in anaerobic metabolism, including those for the production of hydrogenase, formate hydrogenlyase, and methylamine dehydrogenase. These genes, along with the organism's ability to utilize a variety of substrates, make it a key player in the complex web of anaerobic metabolism in marine sediments.

The results revealed the presence of the hydrogenase gene hdrABC, the formate hydrogenlyase gene fhlA, and the methylamine dehydrogenase gene mxaF, among others. These genes are crucial for the organism's ability to produce hydrogen gas, utilize formate as an electron acceptor, and oxidize methylamines.

The study also found that the addition of formate or methylamine to the organism's culture could stimulate hydrogen evolution, indicating that these substrates can serve as electron donors for this process. This further highlights the importance of M. maripaludis in anaerobic metabolism and its role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in anoxic sediments.

##### Case Study 2: Microbial Interactions in Anoxic Sediments

In addition to individual organisms, the interactions between microbial communities also play a significant role in anaerobic metabolism. In a study conducted by Kallmeyer et al. (2006), the interactions between M. maripaludis and other microorganisms in anoxic sediments were investigated.

The results revealed that M. maripaludis can form syntrophic partnerships with other microorganisms, such as Syntrophus aciditrophicus and Syntrophus bryantii. These partnerships allow for the efficient cycling of organic matter and nutrients, as each organism contributes a unique metabolic capability.

For example, S. aciditrophicus is capable of utilizing acetate as an electron acceptor, while S. bryantii can utilize propionate. M. maripaludis, on the other hand, can utilize hydrogen gas, formate, and methylamines. By working together, these organisms can efficiently cycle organic matter and nutrients in anoxic sediments.

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the crucial role of anaerobic metabolism and microbial communities in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in anoxic sediments.

### Section: 10.2 Biogeochemical Processes in Sulfidic and Methanic Sediments:

#### 10.2a Introduction to Sulfidic and Methanic Sediments

Sulfidic and methanic sediments are two types of anoxic marine sediments that play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. These sediments are characterized by their high concentrations of sulfides and methane, respectively, which are the result of microbial activity.

Sulfidic sediments are formed when sulfate-reducing bacteria convert sulfate to sulfide. This process is an important part of the sulfur cycle, and it also has significant implications for the carbon cycle. Sulfate-reducing bacteria use organic matter as an electron donor, and in the process, they produce hydrogen sulfide. This hydrogen sulfide can then react with iron(III) oxide, a common mineral in marine sediments, to form iron(II) sulfide. This process effectively removes iron from the sediment, which can then be buried and stored for long periods of time. This process also contributes to the burial of carbon, as the organic matter used by sulfate-reducing bacteria is typically derived from the decomposition of marine organisms.

Methanic sediments, on the other hand, are formed when methanogenic archaea convert hydrogen and carbon dioxide to methane. This process is an important part of the methane cycle, and it also has implications for the carbon cycle. Methanogenic archaea use hydrogen and carbon dioxide as electron donors, and in the process, they produce methane. This methane can then be transported to the water column, where it can contribute to the greenhouse effect. However, a significant portion of methane is also buried in the sediment, where it can be stored for long periods of time. This process also contributes to the burial of carbon, as the hydrogen and carbon dioxide used by methanogenic archaea are typically derived from the decomposition of marine organisms.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the biogeochemical processes that occur in sulfidic and methanic sediments, and explore the role of microbial communities in these processes.

#### 10.2b Biogeochemical Processes in Sulfidic Sediments

Sulfidic sediments are characterized by their high concentrations of sulfides, which are primarily the result of microbial activity. The primary microbial process responsible for the formation of sulfidic sediments is sulfate reduction. This process is carried out by sulfate-reducing bacteria, which use organic matter as an electron donor to convert sulfate to sulfide. The sulfide produced by these bacteria can then react with iron(III) oxide, a common mineral in marine sediments, to form iron(II) sulfide. This process effectively removes iron from the sediment, which can then be buried and stored for long periods of time. This process also contributes to the burial of carbon, as the organic matter used by sulfate-reducing bacteria is typically derived from the decomposition of marine organisms.

The formation of sulfidic sediments also has significant implications for the global carbon cycle. The burial of carbon in these sediments can help to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Additionally, the production of hydrogen sulfide by sulfate-reducing bacteria can also contribute to the formation of hydrocarbons, which are a significant component of the global carbon cycle.

#### 10.2c Biogeochemical Processes in Methanic Sediments

Methanic sediments, on the other hand, are characterized by their high concentrations of methane, which are primarily the result of microbial activity. The primary microbial process responsible for the formation of methanic sediments is methanogenesis. This process is carried out by methanogenic archaea, which use hydrogen and carbon dioxide as electron donors to convert these compounds to methane.

The production of methane in these sediments can have significant implications for the global carbon cycle. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and its production and release into the atmosphere can contribute to climate change. However, a significant portion of methane is also buried in these sediments, where it can be stored for long periods of time. This process can help to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing the amount of methane in the atmosphere.

Furthermore, the production of methane in these sediments can also contribute to the formation of hydrocarbons. Methane can react with other compounds in the sediment to form a variety of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and oil. This process can have significant economic implications, as these hydrocarbons can be extracted and used as a source of energy.

In conclusion, the biogeochemical processes that occur in sulfidic and methanic sediments play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. These processes not only contribute to the burial of carbon, but also have significant implications for the production of hydrocarbons and the mitigation of climate change. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change.

### Section: 10.2 Biogeochemical Processes in Sulfidic and Methanic Sediments:

#### 10.2b Major Biogeochemical Processes

The biogeochemical processes in sulfidic and methanic sediments are complex and interconnected. They involve the transformation of various elements and compounds, including carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and iron, among others. These processes are primarily driven by microbial communities, which play a crucial role in shaping the geochemical properties of these sediments.

#### 10.2b.1 Sulfate Reduction

Sulfate reduction is a key process in sulfidic sediments. It is primarily driven by sulfate-reducing bacteria, which use sulfate as an electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration. The process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{SO}_4^{2-} + 2\text{CH}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow \text{HCO}_3^- + \text{HS}^- + \text{H}_4\text{C}_2\text{O}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In this process, sulfate is reduced to hydrogen sulfide, which is then used as an electron donor for the reduction of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. This process contributes to the burial of carbon, as the bicarbonate can be incorporated into the sediment and eventually into sedimentary rocks.

#### 10.2b.2 Methanogenesis

Methanogenesis is a key process in methanic sediments. It is primarily driven by methanogenic archaea, which use hydrogen and carbon dioxide as electron donors for the production of methane. The process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{H}_2 + \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{HCO}_3^-
$$

In this process, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are reduced to methane, which can then be transported to the water column. However, a significant portion of methane is also buried in the sediment, where it can contribute to the long-term storage of carbon.

#### 10.2b.3 Iron Cycling

Iron cycling is another important process in both sulfidic and methanic sediments. It involves the transformation of iron between different oxidation states, which can have significant implications for the availability of nutrients and the overall productivity of marine ecosystems.

In sulfidic sediments, iron(III) oxide can be reduced to iron(II) sulfide by hydrogen sulfide produced during sulfate reduction. This process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow \text{Fe}_2\text{S}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

In methanic sediments, iron(II) can be oxidized to iron(III) by methane oxidizing bacteria, which use methane as an electron donor for the reduction of iron. This process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{CH}_4 + \text{Fe}^{2+} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{Fe}^{3+} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

These processes can have significant implications for the availability of iron, a key nutrient for many marine organisms. They can also influence the redox conditions of the sediment, which can in turn affect the distribution and activity of microbial communities.

#### 10.2b.4 Nitrogen Cycling

Nitrogen cycling is another important process in both sulfidic and methanic sediments. It involves the transformation of nitrogen between different forms, including nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and various organic forms.

In sulfidic sediments, nitrate can be reduced to nitrite by denitrifying bacteria, which use nitrate as an electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration. This process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{NO}_3^- + \text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow \text{NO}_2^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{S}
$$

In methanic sediments, nitrite can be further reduced to ammonium by nitrite-reducing bacteria. This process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{NO}_2^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

These processes can have significant implications for the availability of nitrogen, a key nutrient for many marine organisms. They can also influence the redox conditions of the sediment, which can in turn affect the distribution and activity of microbial communities.

#### 10.2b.5 Carbon Cycling

Carbon cycling is a key process in both sulfidic and methanic sediments. It involves the transformation of carbon between different forms, including carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, and various organic forms.

In sulfidic sediments, carbon dioxide can be reduced to bicarbonate by sulfate-reducing bacteria, which use carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration. This process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{S} \rightarrow \text{HCO}_3^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{S}
$$

In methanic sediments, bicarbonate can be further reduced to organic carbon by methanogenic archaea. This process can be represented as follows:

$$
\text{HCO}_3^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CH}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3
$$

These processes can have significant implications for the carbon cycle, as they can influence the amount of carbon that is buried in the sediment and eventually removed from the atmosphere. They can also affect the pH of the sediment, which can in turn influence the distribution and activity of microbial communities.

#### 10.2c Impact of Biogeochemical Processes on Organic Matter

The biogeochemical processes in sulfidic and methanic sediments have a profound impact on the organic matter present in these environments. The transformation of organic matter is primarily driven by microbial communities, which utilize various biogeochemical processes to degrade and modify organic compounds.

#### 10.2c.1 Organic Matter Transformation

The transformation of organic matter in sulfidic and methanic sediments is primarily driven by the biogeochemical processes of sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, and iron cycling. These processes can significantly alter the composition of organic matter, leading to the production of various biomarkers and other organic compounds.

For instance, sulfate reduction can lead to the production of sulfide, which can react with organic matter to form thiols and other sulfur-containing compounds. Similarly, methanogenesis can lead to the production of methane, which can be used as a tracer for the detection of anoxic conditions. Iron cycling, on the other hand, can lead to the formation of iron oxides, which can adsorb organic compounds and influence their degradation.

#### 10.2c.2 Organic Matter Burial

The burial of organic matter in sulfidic and methanic sediments is a crucial process for the long-term storage of carbon. As mentioned earlier, a significant portion of methane produced during methanogenesis is buried in the sediment, where it can contribute to the burial of carbon. Similarly, the bicarbonate produced during sulfate reduction can also be incorporated into the sediment and contribute to the burial of carbon.

The burial of organic matter is also influenced by the redox conditions of the sediment. For instance, the presence of sulfate can inhibit the burial of organic matter, as sulfate reduction can consume hydrogen and other electron donors that are necessary for the burial of organic matter. Therefore, the redox conditions of the sediment can significantly influence the amount of organic matter that is buried.

#### 10.2c.3 Organic Matter Preservation

The preservation of organic matter in sulfidic and methanic sediments is a complex process that is influenced by various factors, including the redox conditions of the sediment, the composition of the organic matter, and the presence of mineral phases that can adsorb organic compounds.

For instance, the presence of sulfide can inhibit the preservation of organic matter, as sulfide can react with organic compounds and lead to their degradation. Similarly, the presence of iron oxides can also inhibit the preservation of organic matter, as iron oxides can adsorb organic compounds and prevent their burial.

However, the presence of certain mineral phases, such as carbonates and evaporites, can enhance the preservation of organic matter. These mineral phases can adsorb organic compounds and protect them from degradation, leading to the formation of organic-rich sediments.

In conclusion, the biogeochemical processes in sulfidic and methanic sediments have a profound impact on the organic matter present in these environments. These processes can significantly alter the composition of organic matter, influence its burial and preservation, and ultimately contribute to the long-term storage of carbon.

This process is essential for the survival and growth of marine organisms, and it also contributes to the overall productivity of the marine ecosystem.

##### Impact on Marine Productivity

The impact of organic phosphorus on marine productivity is significant. Phosphorus is a key nutrient for marine organisms, and its availability can limit the growth and productivity of these organisms. Studies have shown that an increase in the availability of organic phosphorus can lead to an increase in marine productivity (Smith et al., 2006). This is particularly important in the context of climate change, as changes in ocean temperature and acidity can affect the availability of organic phosphorus and, consequently, marine productivity.

##### Implications for Climate Change

Climate change is expected to have significant implications for the availability of organic phosphorus in marine environments. As ocean temperatures rise, the solubility of phosphorus in seawater is expected to decrease, leading to a decrease in the availability of organic phosphorus (Kroeker et al., 2005). This could have profound implications for marine productivity and the overall health of marine ecosystems.

In addition, climate change is also expected to increase ocean acidity, which can affect the mineralization of organic phosphorus. As mentioned earlier, the mineralization of organic phosphorus is a key process in the cycling of phosphorus in marine environments. If ocean acidity increases, this process could be affected, leading to further changes in the availability of organic phosphorus.

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, organic phosphorus plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems. Its role in the food chain, its impact on marine productivity, and its implications for climate change make it a key area of study in marine organic geochemistry. Understanding the biological significance of organic phosphorus is essential for predicting the future of marine ecosystems in the face of climate change.

#### 11.2a Introduction to Phosphorus Cycling

Phosphorus is a critical element in marine ecosystems, playing a vital role in the growth and development of marine organisms. It is a key component of DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of all cells. The phosphorus cycle in marine environments is a complex process that involves various biological, chemical, and physical processes.

##### Phosphorus Sources in Marine Ecosystems

Phosphorus enters marine ecosystems primarily through weathering of rocks and sediments, atmospheric deposition, and riverine input. Weathering of rocks and sediments releases phosphorus into the soil, which is then transported to the ocean via river runoff. Atmospheric deposition, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, also contributes a significant amount of phosphorus to the ocean.

##### Phosphorus Cycling in Marine Ecosystems

Once in the ocean, phosphorus undergoes various transformations. It can be assimilated by phytoplankton and other marine organisms, incorporated into their tissues, and eventually returned to the water column when these organisms die and decompose. Phosphorus can also be adsorbed onto sediment particles, where it can remain for long periods of time.

##### Phosphorus Limitations in Marine Ecosystems

Despite its abundance in the ocean, phosphorus can be a limiting nutrient in marine ecosystems. This is particularly true in the open ocean, where phosphorus concentrations are often below the detection limit of traditional analytical methods. The low phosphorus concentrations in the open ocean are primarily due to the slow rate of phosphorus cycling and the high affinity of phosphorus for sediment particles.

##### Phosphorus and Climate Change

The role of phosphorus in climate change is an emerging area of research. Recent studies have shown that organic phosphorus can be a significant source of carbon in the ocean, contributing to the ocean's carbon pool. As the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, some of it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, which can then dissolve calcium carbonate, the main component of shells and bones. This process can lead to ocean acidification, which can have significant impacts on marine organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for their shells and bones.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the various processes involved in phosphorus cycling and limitation in marine ecosystems, and explore the implications of these processes for marine organisms and the global climate system.

#### 11.2b Phosphorus Limitation and Productivity

Phosphorus limitation is a critical factor in marine ecosystems, particularly in the open ocean where phosphorus concentrations are often below the detection limit of traditional analytical methods. This limitation can significantly impact marine productivity, as it restricts the growth and development of marine organisms.

##### Phosphorus Limitation and Marine Productivity

Phosphorus limitation can lead to a decrease in marine productivity, as it restricts the growth and development of marine organisms. This is particularly true for phytoplankton, which are the primary producers in marine ecosystems. Phytoplankton require phosphorus for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), all of which are essential for cell growth and division. Without sufficient phosphorus, phytoplankton cannot proliferate, leading to a decrease in marine productivity.

##### Phosphorus Limitation and Climate Change

The impact of phosphorus limitation on marine productivity is particularly significant in the context of climate change. As the ocean absorbs increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the ocean's pH decreases, leading to ocean acidification. This process can also increase the solubility of carbonate ions, which can react with phosphorus to form insoluble phosphates. This process can further exacerbate phosphorus limitation in the ocean, leading to a decrease in marine productivity.

##### Phosphorus Limitation and Marine Ecosystems

Phosphorus limitation can also have significant implications for marine ecosystems. In areas where phosphorus is limited, the dominance of certain species can shift, leading to changes in the structure and function of marine ecosystems. For example, in areas where phosphorus is limited, smaller species of phytoplankton may dominate, as they require less phosphorus for growth and division. This shift can have cascading effects on the rest of the food chain, as larger species of phytoplankton are often the primary food source for many marine organisms.

In conclusion, phosphorus limitation plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, impacting marine productivity, climate change, and the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms of phosphorus limitation and its implications for marine ecosystems is therefore essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.

#### 11.2c Strategies for Overcoming Phosphorus Limitation

Overcoming phosphorus limitation in marine ecosystems is a complex task that requires a multifaceted approach. This section will explore some of the strategies that can be employed to overcome phosphorus limitation and enhance marine productivity.

##### Enhancing Phosphorus Availability

One strategy for overcoming phosphorus limitation is to enhance the availability of phosphorus in the water column. This can be achieved through various means, including the addition of phosphorus fertilizers or the stimulation of phosphorus release from sediments.

Phosphorus fertilizers can be added directly to the water column, providing a direct source of phosphorus for marine organisms. However, this approach can also lead to eutrophication, which can have detrimental effects on marine ecosystems. Therefore, careful management is required to ensure that phosphorus fertilizers are applied in a sustainable manner.

Another approach is to stimulate the release of phosphorus from sediments. This can be achieved through the use of chemicals that can dissolve phosphorus compounds, or through the mechanical disturbance of sediments, which can increase the rate of phosphorus mineralization.

##### Improving Phosphorus Uptake

In addition to enhancing phosphorus availability, strategies can also be employed to improve the uptake of phosphorus by marine organisms. This can be achieved through the use of phosphorus-solubilizing microorganisms, which can increase the solubility of phosphorus compounds and enhance their availability for uptake by marine organisms.

Furthermore, the development of genetically modified marine organisms that have enhanced phosphorus uptake capabilities can also be considered. However, this approach requires careful consideration of the potential environmental impacts and the ethical implications.

##### Mitigating the Impacts of Climate Change

Given the potential impacts of climate change on phosphorus availability, strategies for mitigating these impacts are also crucial. This can include efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which can help to slow down the rate of ocean acidification and the increase in soluble carbonate ions.

Additionally, efforts can be made to enhance the buffering capacity of the ocean, which can help to counteract the decrease in pH and the increase in soluble carbonate ions. This can be achieved through the addition of calcium carbonate, which can react with hydrogen ions to increase the pH and reduce the solubility of carbonate ions.

In conclusion, overcoming phosphorus limitation in marine ecosystems requires a multifaceted approach that includes enhancing phosphorus availability, improving phosphorus uptake, and mitigating the impacts of climate change. By employing these strategies, it is possible to enhance marine productivity and maintain the health and resilience of marine ecosystems in the face of increasing phosphorus limitation and climate change.

#### 11.2b Major Processes in Phosphorus Cycling

The phosphorus cycle in marine ecosystems is a complex process that involves various biological, chemical, and physical processes. These processes work together to regulate the availability of phosphorus in the ocean, influencing the growth and development of marine organisms.

##### Weathering of Rocks and Sediments

Weathering of rocks and sediments is a primary source of phosphorus in marine ecosystems. This process involves the breakdown of rocks and sediments by physical, chemical, and biological means. The weathering of phosphorus-containing rocks, such as apatite, releases phosphorus into the soil, which is then transported to the ocean via river runoff.

##### Atmospheric Deposition

Atmospheric deposition is another significant source of phosphorus in the ocean. Phosphorus enters the ocean through the atmosphere primarily from the burning of fossil fuels. This atmospheric phosphorus can be assimilated by marine organisms and incorporated into their tissues, contributing to the phosphorus pool in the ocean.

##### Assimilation by Marine Organisms

Once in the ocean, phosphorus can be assimilated by marine organisms, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and larger marine organisms. Phosphorus is a key component of DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of all cells. Therefore, it is essential for the growth and development of marine organisms.

##### Sedimentation and Burial

When marine organisms die and decompose, their tissues, including the phosphorus they contain, can settle to the seafloor. This process, known as sedimentation, can remove phosphorus from the water column, reducing its availability to marine organisms. However, some of this sedimented phosphorus can be buried in sediment layers, where it can remain for long periods of time.

##### Biological and Chemical Transformations

Phosphorus in the ocean can undergo various biological and chemical transformations. For example, phosphorus can be transformed from inorganic to organic forms by marine organisms, such as phytoplankton. This process can increase the availability of phosphorus to other marine organisms. Additionally, phosphorus can be transformed through chemical reactions, such as hydrolysis and precipitation, which can influence its solubility and availability in the ocean.

##### Phosphorus Limitations in Marine Ecosystems

Despite its abundance in the ocean, phosphorus can be a limiting nutrient in marine ecosystems. This is particularly true in the open ocean, where phosphorus concentrations are often below the detection limit of traditional analytical methods. The low phosphorus concentrations in the open ocean are primarily due to the slow rate of phosphorus cycling and the high affinity of phosphorus for sediment particles.

In conclusion, the phosphorus cycle in marine ecosystems is a complex process that involves various biological, chemical, and physical processes. These processes work together to regulate the availability of phosphorus in the ocean, influencing the growth and development of marine organisms. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change and other environmental changes on marine ecosystems.

#### 11.2c Case Studies of Phosphorus Cycling and Limitation

To further illustrate the complex processes involved in phosphorus cycling and limitation in marine ecosystems, let's examine two case studies: the Selli Event and the modern ocean.

##### The Selli Event

The Selli Event, a major oceanic anoxic event (OAE) that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, provides a unique opportunity to study phosphorus cycling and limitation in a past marine ecosystem. During this event, an increase in marine productivity led to an increase in phosphorus demand, which was met by an increase in phosphorus supply from weathering of the continents and hydrothermal vents. This increase in phosphorus availability led to a spike in marine productivity, as seen in the increase in the number of foraminifera species.

However, the Selli Event also demonstrates the potential for phosphorus limitation in marine ecosystems. The increase in phosphorus demand and supply led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which can inhibit phosphorus availability by precipitating it as iron phosphate. This precipitation can limit phosphorus availability to marine organisms, leading to a decrease in marine productivity.

##### The Modern Ocean

In the modern ocean, phosphorus limitation is a more common occurrence due to human activities. The burning of fossil fuels has increased atmospheric phosphorus deposition, leading to an increase in phosphorus availability in the ocean. However, this increase in phosphorus availability has not led to an increase in marine productivity, likely due to other nutrient limitations.

Furthermore, the increase in atmospheric phosphorus deposition has led to an increase in sedimentation and burial of phosphorus, reducing its availability in the water column. This process can lead to phosphorus depletion in the ocean, as seen in the decrease in phosphorus concentrations in the open ocean.

These case studies highlight the complex and dynamic nature of phosphorus cycling and limitation in marine ecosystems. They also underscore the importance of understanding these processes in predicting the impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems.

### Conclusion

##### Reduced Marine Productivity

Phosphorus is a key nutrient for marine productivity. It is a component of DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of all cells. Therefore, a lack of phosphorus can limit the growth and development of marine organisms, reducing marine productivity. This was evident during the Selli Event, where an increase in phosphorus availability led to a spike in marine productivity (Kenig et al., 2009).

##### Changes in Species Composition

Phosphorus limitation can also lead to changes in species composition in marine ecosystems. Species that are better equipped to acquire and utilize phosphorus may thrive under phosphorus-limited conditions, while those that are less efficient at phosphorus uptake may decline. This was observed during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, where the decline in phosphorus retention ability of seafloor sediments led to changes in species composition (Kenig et al., 2009).

##### Impact on Anoxia

Phosphorus plays a crucial role in the cycling of carbon and sulphur in marine ecosystems. It is involved in the production of hydrogen sulphide, which can inhibit the burial of phosphorus on the seafloor and enable the development of anoxia. Therefore, phosphorus limitation can exacerbate anoxic conditions in the ocean, as seen during the Selli Event (Kenig et al., 2009).

##### Effects on Ocean Acidification

Phosphorus limitation can also impact ocean acidification. The large-scale volcanic release of carbon dioxide during the Selli Event caused a drop in the pH of seawater, leading to ocean acidification. Phosphorus availability can influence the ocean's carbonate-saturation, which can affect the severity of ocean acidification. Therefore, phosphorus limitation can exacerbate the effects of ocean acidification (Kenig et al., 2009).

##### Role in Weathering

Phosphorus limitation can also influence the weathering of rocks and sediments. During the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, the decline in phosphorus retention ability of seafloor sediments led to an increase in silicate weathering. This weathering may have buffered the warming effects of large igneous province volcanism and helped to cool the Earth back to its pre-OAE1a state (Kenig et al., 2009).

In conclusion, phosphorus limitation can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems, influencing marine productivity, species composition, anoxia, ocean acidification, and weathering. Understanding these impacts is crucial for predicting the future of our oceans under changing environmental conditions.

### Introduction

The study of marine organic geochemistry is a vast and complex field, encompassing a wide range of disciplines and methodologies. One of the most important tools in this field is radiocarbon analysis, which allows us to determine the age of organic materials and understand their role in the modern marine environment. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of old carbon in the modern marine environment and the insights that radiocarbon analysis provides.

Radiocarbon analysis is a powerful technique that allows us to date organic materials by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, present in the sample. By comparing the amount of carbon-14 to the known amount of carbon-12, we can determine the age of the sample. This technique is particularly useful for studying old carbon, which is carbon that has been stored in the marine environment for long periods of time.

The presence of old carbon in the modern marine environment is a result of the complex interplay between biological, geological, and chemical processes. These processes can lead to the storage of carbon in various forms, such as sedimentary organic matter, dissolved organic carbon, and particulate organic carbon. By studying the age and distribution of these forms of carbon, we can gain valuable insights into the functioning of the marine ecosystem and its impact on the global carbon cycle.

In this chapter, we will delve into the various aspects of old carbon in the modern marine environment, including its sources, sinks, and transformations. We will also explore the role of radiocarbon analysis in understanding the dynamics of old carbon and its implications for the future of our planet. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the complex and fascinating world of marine organic geochemistry and the role of radiocarbon analysis in unraveling its mysteries.

The presence of old carbon in the modern marine environment is a result of the complex interplay between biological, geological, and chemical processes. These processes can lead to the storage of carbon in various forms, such as sedimentary organic matter, dissolved organic carbon, and particulate organic carbon. By studying the age and distribution of these forms of carbon, we can gain valuable insights into the functioning of the marine ecosystem and its impact on the global carbon cycle.

One of the key factors that can affect the accuracy of radiocarbon dating is the presence of ancient carbon in modern systems. Ancient carbon, also known as old carbon, is carbon that has been stored in the marine environment for long periods of time, often thousands of years. This carbon can have a significant impact on the radiocarbon dating of modern samples, as it can introduce a false age component.

The presence of ancient carbon in modern systems can be attributed to various factors, including the mixing of deep and surface waters, the release of carbon from sediments, and the input of carbon from terrestrial sources. These processes can introduce ancient carbon into the modern marine environment, leading to a reduction in the <chem|14|C>/<chem|12|C> ratio in the water. This can result in apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it.

To account for the presence of ancient carbon in modern systems, additional research is often needed to determine the size of the offset. This can be done by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material. By understanding the extent of the offset, we can better interpret the radiocarbon dates of modern samples and gain a more accurate understanding of the age of the carbon in the marine environment.

In the next section, we will explore the various sources and sinks of old carbon in the marine environment, and how they contribute to the overall carbon cycle. We will also discuss the role of radiocarbon analysis in understanding the dynamics of old carbon and its implications for the future of our planet.

#### 12.1b Radiocarbon Dating Techniques

Radiocarbon dating is a technique used to determine the age of organic materials by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, in a sample. This technique is particularly useful for studying old carbon, which is carbon that has been stored in the marine environment for long periods of time.

The process of radiocarbon dating involves measuring the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a sample. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope that decays over time, while carbon-12 is a stable isotope. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 in a sample, we can determine its age.

The radiocarbon dating technique is based on the principle that the amount of carbon-14 in a sample is directly proportional to the amount of carbon-12. This is because carbon-14 is constantly being produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and it is incorporated into living organisms through photosynthesis. As the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon-14, and the amount of carbon-14 in the sample decreases over time due to radioactive decay.

To determine the age of a sample using radiocarbon dating, we first need to measure the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the sample. This is done by analyzing the sample for the presence of carbon-14 using various techniques, such as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) or liquid scintillation counting.

Once the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is determined, we can use this information to calculate the age of the sample. This is done by comparing the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the sample to the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere at the time the sample was alive. The difference in these ratios can then be used to calculate the age of the sample.

Radiocarbon dating has been used to study a wide range of marine environments, from the deep sea to the surface waters. It has been particularly useful in understanding the age of sedimentary organic matter, which can provide valuable insights into the functioning of the marine ecosystem.

In addition to studying the age of organic materials, radiocarbon dating has also been used to study the carbon cycle in the marine environment. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 in different forms of carbon, we can gain a better understanding of how carbon is being stored and released in the marine environment.

Overall, radiocarbon dating is a powerful tool for studying the marine environment and its complex carbon cycle. By combining this technique with other methods, such as the Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) method, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the age and distribution of carbon in the marine environment.

These contaminants can enter the marine environment through various sources, both natural and anthropogenic. In this section, we will discuss the major sources of organic contaminants in marine environments.

#### Industrial Activities

One of the primary sources of organic contaminants in marine environments is industrial activities. These activities involve the use of various chemicals, including solvents, pesticides, and heavy metals, which can be toxic to marine organisms. These chemicals can enter the marine environment through direct discharge or through runoff from industrial sites.

For example, the production of chlorophenols and chlorophenoxy acid herbicides can result in the release of dioxins, which are highly toxic and persistent organic pollutants. These chemicals can also be released during the application of herbicides, particularly in developing countries where there may be limited regulations and safety protocols.

#### Incineration

Incineration is another significant source of organic contaminants in marine environments. The burning of organic materials, whether in the presence of chlorine or not, can result in the formation of dioxins. These chemicals can then be released into the atmosphere, where they can be transported to marine environments through precipitation or direct deposition.

In the United States, incineration was once the primary source of dioxin emissions, accounting for more than 80% of known sources. However, with the implementation of new emissions requirements, incineration now accounts for less than 3% of all dioxin emissions.

#### Backyard Barrel Burning

Despite the decrease in dioxin emissions from incineration, backyard barrel burning has shown almost no decrease and is now the largest source of dioxin emissions in the United States. This practice involves the burning of household waste, including materials that may contain organic contaminants, in barrels or other containers. The smoke from these fires can release toxic chemicals into the atmosphere, which can then be transported to marine environments.

#### Natural Processes

Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions and wildfires, can also contribute to the release of organic contaminants in marine environments. These events can release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, which can then be transported to the ocean through precipitation or direct deposition. These gases can have a significant impact on marine ecosystems, particularly in areas where they are not well-buffered by carbonate minerals.

In addition to these sources, there are also concerns about the potential release of organic contaminants from deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. These environments are home to unique microbial communities that can produce and degrade organic compounds. However, the potential impact of these compounds on marine ecosystems is still being studied.

In conclusion, organic contaminants in marine environments have a variety of sources, both natural and anthropogenic. These contaminants can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and human health, making it crucial to continue studying and regulating their release into the environment. 





### Subsection: 13.1b Fate and Transport of Organic Contaminants

Once organic contaminants enter the marine environment, they can undergo various processes that affect their fate and transport. These processes include adsorption, desorption, volatilization, and biodegradation.

#### Adsorption and Desorption

Adsorption is the process by which organic contaminants bind to soil particles, while desorption is the reverse process. These processes can affect the mobility and bioavailability of organic contaminants in the marine environment. For example, the adsorption of organic contaminants to sediment particles can reduce their mobility, while desorption can increase their bioavailability to marine organisms.

#### Volatilization

Volatilization is the process by which organic contaminants are released into the atmosphere from the marine environment. This process can occur through evaporation or through the action of microorganisms. Volatilization can reduce the concentration of organic contaminants in the marine environment, but it can also lead to their long-range transport and deposition in other areas.

#### Biodegradation

Biodegradation is the process by which organic contaminants are broken down by microorganisms. This process can reduce the concentration of organic contaminants in the marine environment, but it can also lead to the formation of other potentially harmful substances. For example, the biodegradation of chlorophenols can result in the formation of chlorophenoxy acids, which can also be toxic to marine organisms.

#### Transport of Organic Contaminants

Organic contaminants can be transported through various pathways in the marine environment. These pathways include water currents, sediment transport, and the food chain. Water currents can transport organic contaminants over long distances, while sediment transport can bury them in the seafloor. The food chain can also transport organic contaminants from lower trophic levels to higher trophic levels, potentially affecting the health of marine organisms and humans.

In conclusion, the fate and transport of organic contaminants in marine environments are complex processes that can be influenced by various factors. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting the impact of organic contaminants on marine ecosystems and for developing effective strategies for their management and mitigation.

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the sources and fate of organic contaminants in marine environments. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the complex processes involved in the transport and transformation of organic contaminants in the sea.

#### Case Study 1: The Impact of Industrial Activities on Marine Organic Contaminants

The Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Dallas, is a prime example of how industrial activities can lead to the contamination of marine environments. During the 1940s, the plant released a variety of hazardous substances, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and metals, into nearby water bodies. These substances were used in the fabrication of aircraft, aerospace equipment, and prototype weapons.

The contamination of Mountain Creek Lake and other surrounding water bodies was confirmed in the 1980s through a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) investigation. The Department of Defense (DOD) was notified about the hazardous water contamination in 1991. High levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in fish tissue samples from Mountain Creek Lake, indicating the bioaccumulation of these contaminants in the food chain.

This case study highlights the potential long-term impacts of industrial activities on marine environments and the importance of proper waste management and disposal practices.

#### Case Study 2: The Role of Microorganisms in the Biodegradation of Organic Contaminants

The biodegradation of organic contaminants in marine environments is a complex process that involves the interaction of various microorganisms. For instance, the biodegradation of chlorophenols, a common type of organic contaminant, is carried out by a consortium of bacteria that includes species of Sphingomonas and Burkholderia.

The biodegradation process begins with the oxidation of chlorophenols to chlorocatechols, which is catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as chlorophenol dioxygenases. The chlorocatechols are then further degraded to non-toxic compounds through a series of hydrolysis and oxidation reactions.

This case study underscores the importance of microorganisms in the detoxification of organic contaminants in marine environments. However, it also highlights the potential for the formation of other harmful substances during the biodegradation process, such as chlorophenoxy acids.

#### Case Study 3: The Impact of Climate Change on the Distribution of Organic Contaminants

Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on the distribution of organic contaminants in marine environments. Changes in temperature and ocean currents can alter the solubility and mobility of these contaminants, affecting their transport and bioavailability.

For example, warmer ocean temperatures can increase the solubility of certain organic contaminants, leading to their increased mobility and potential for long-range transport. On the other hand, changes in ocean currents can alter the pathways of contaminant transport, potentially leading to their accumulation in new areas.

This case study highlights the need for ongoing research to understand the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of organic contaminants in marine environments.

In conclusion, these case studies provide a glimpse into the complex processes involved in the sources and fate of organic contaminants in marine environments. They underscore the importance of understanding these processes to mitigate the impacts of these contaminants on marine ecosystems and human health.

## Chapter 14: Methods in Marine Organic Geochemistry




### Introduction

The study of marine organic geochemistry is a vast and complex field that encompasses the understanding of the origin, transformation, and fate of organic matter in the marine environment. This chapter, "Fate of Organic Matter Over Geologic Time: From Sedimentation to Petroleum Formation," delves into the intricate processes that govern the journey of organic matter from its initial sedimentation to its eventual transformation into petroleum.

The chapter begins by exploring the concept of sedimentation, a fundamental process in the burial of organic matter. Sedimentation is the process by which particles settle from a fluid suspension, and it plays a crucial role in the accumulation of organic matter in the sedimentary environment. The chapter will discuss the various factors that influence sedimentation, including the physical properties of the particles, the characteristics of the fluid medium, and the environmental conditions.

Following sedimentation, the organic matter undergoes a series of transformations that can lead to the formation of petroleum. These transformations involve the breakdown of organic molecules under the influence of various physical and chemical processes, including diagenesis, catagenesis, and metagenesis. Each of these processes plays a unique role in the conversion of organic matter into petroleum, and the chapter will provide a detailed overview of these processes.

The chapter will also discuss the role of microorganisms in the transformation of organic matter. Microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, and fungi, play a crucial role in the degradation and transformation of organic matter in the marine environment. The chapter will explore the different types of microorganisms involved in these processes and their specific roles.

Finally, the chapter will discuss the implications of these processes for the geological record and the potential for hydrocarbon exploration. The study of the fate of organic matter over geologic time is not only of academic interest but also has significant practical implications for the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons. The chapter will discuss how the understanding of these processes can inform the exploration for and extraction of petroleum.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the fate of organic matter over geologic time, from sedimentation to petroleum formation. It will delve into the complex processes that govern the journey of organic matter in the marine environment, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and research in this fascinating field.




### Subsection: 14.1a Introduction to Sedimentation and Preservation

Sedimentation is a fundamental process in the burial of organic matter in the marine environment. It is the process by which particles settle from a fluid suspension, and it plays a crucial role in the accumulation of organic matter in the sedimentary environment. The sedimentation process is influenced by various factors, including the physical properties of the particles, the characteristics of the fluid medium, and the environmental conditions.

#### 14.1a.1 Factors Influencing Sedimentation

The physical properties of the particles, such as their size, shape, and density, play a significant role in sedimentation. Larger and denser particles tend to settle faster than smaller and less dense particles. This is due to Stokes' Law, which states that the settling velocity of a particle is inversely proportional to its diameter and the viscosity of the fluid medium.

The characteristics of the fluid medium, such as its viscosity and turbulence, also influence sedimentation. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow, and it affects the ability of particles to move through the fluid. Turbulence, on the other hand, can disrupt the settling of particles by creating chaotic fluid motion.

Environmental conditions, such as temperature and salinity, can also impact sedimentation. Changes in temperature and salinity can affect the density of the fluid medium, which in turn affects the settling of particles. For example, an increase in temperature can decrease the density of seawater, making it more difficult for particles to settle. Similarly, an increase in salinity can increase the density of seawater, promoting sedimentation.

#### 14.1a.2 Preservation of Organic Matter

Once organic matter is sedimented, it can undergo a series of transformations that can lead to the formation of petroleum. However, the preservation of organic matter is a critical step in this process. Organic matter can be preserved in sedimentary rocks through various mechanisms, including diagenesis, catagenesis, and metagenesis.

Diagenesis is the process by which sedimentary rocks are formed from sediment. It involves the compaction and cementation of sediment, which can lead to the preservation of organic matter. Catagenesis, on the other hand, is the process by which organic matter is transformed into hydrocarbons, such as petroleum and natural gas. This process is influenced by temperature, pressure, and the composition of the organic matter.

Metagenesis is the process by which hydrocarbons are further transformed into more stable forms, such as graphite and methane. This process is typically associated with high temperatures and pressures, and it can occur in the deep subsurface.

In conclusion, sedimentation and preservation of organic matter are crucial steps in the journey of organic matter from sedimentation to petroleum formation. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting the distribution and abundance of hydrocarbons in the Earth's subsurface.




### Subsection: 14.1b Major Processes in Sedimentation and Preservation

The sedimentation and preservation of organic matter in the marine environment are governed by a series of major processes. These processes include sedimentation, diagenesis, and compaction.

#### 14.1b.1 Sedimentation

Sedimentation is the process by which particles settle from a fluid suspension. In the marine environment, this process is primarily influenced by the physical properties of the particles, the characteristics of the fluid medium, and environmental conditions. The sedimentation process can be described by Stokes' Law, which states that the settling velocity of a particle is inversely proportional to its diameter and the viscosity of the fluid medium.

#### 14.1b.2 Diagenesis

Diagenesis is a series of chemical and physical processes that occur after sedimentation. These processes can alter the composition and structure of the sediment, including the organic matter it contains. Diagenesis can lead to the formation of new minerals, the recrystallization of existing minerals, and the alteration of the pH and redox conditions of the sediment. These changes can have a significant impact on the preservation of organic matter.

#### 14.1b.3 Compaction

Compaction is a process that occurs after sedimentation and diagenesis. It involves the reduction in volume of sediment due to the application of pressure. Compaction can significantly alter the porosity and permeability of the sediment, which can affect the preservation of organic matter. The rate of compaction is dependent on the chemical composition of the sediment and can vary significantly between different types of sediment.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of these processes in the preservation of organic matter and their implications for the formation of petroleum.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the fate of organic matter over geologic time, from sedimentation to petroleum formation. We have delved into the complex processes that govern the transformation of organic matter from its initial deposition as sediment, through diagenesis and catagenesis, to the formation of hydrocarbons.

Furthermore, we have discussed the role of temperature, pressure, and time in the transformation of organic matter. We have seen how these factors can influence the rate of sedimentation, the intensity of diagenesis and catagenesis, and the quality of the resulting hydrocarbons.

Finally, we have examined the implications of these processes for the exploration and production of petroleum.
