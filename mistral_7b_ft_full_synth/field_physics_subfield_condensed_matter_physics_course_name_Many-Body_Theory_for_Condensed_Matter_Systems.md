# Many-Body Theory for Condensed Matter Systems: A Comprehensive Introduction

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Many-Body Theory

### Subsection 1.1: Many-Body Theory

Many-Body Theory (MBT) is a powerful theoretical framework used to study the behavior of condensed matter systems. It is based on the concept of many-body interactions, where the behavior of a system is determined by the interactions between all of its constituent particles. This theory has been successfully applied to a wide range of systems, from simple metals to complex quantum systems.

MBT is based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. In condensed matter systems, these particles can interact with each other through various mechanisms, such as electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon interactions, and electron-impurity interactions. These interactions can have a significant impact on the properties of the system, and MBT provides a way to understand and predict these effects.

One of the key concepts in MBT is the concept of correlation. Correlation refers to the statistical dependence between particles in a system. In condensed matter systems, correlation can arise from various sources, such as electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon interactions, and electron-impurity interactions. These correlations can have a profound effect on the behavior of the system, and MBT provides a way to study and understand these effects.

MBT has been successfully applied to a wide range of systems, from simple metals to complex quantum systems. In metals, MBT has been used to study the electronic band structure, which describes the allowed energy levels of electrons in a metal. In quantum systems, MBT has been used to study the behavior of particles in strong magnetic fields and in the presence of disorder.

In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive introduction to MBT, starting with its fundamental principles and applications. We will also discuss the various techniques and methods used in MBT, such as perturbation theory, mean field theory, and density functional theory. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of MBT and its applications in condensed matter systems.




### Subsection 1.1a Classical and Quantum Many-Body Systems

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of Many-Body Theory (MBT) and its applications in condensed matter systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the nature of many-body systems and discuss the classical and quantum aspects of these systems.

#### Classical Many-Body Systems

Classical many-body systems are systems that can be described using classical mechanics. These systems are governed by Newton's laws of motion and can be fully described using classical variables such as position and momentum. Examples of classical many-body systems include a gas of classical particles, a crystal lattice, and a plasma.

In classical many-body systems, the interactions between particles are typically assumed to be pairwise and short-ranged. This assumption allows us to use the mean-field approximation, which is a powerful tool for simplifying the equations of motion for these systems. The mean-field approximation assumes that each particle experiences an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual fields created by each particle. This approximation is particularly useful for systems with a large number of particles, where the interactions between particles become statistically indistinguishable.

#### Quantum Many-Body Systems

Quantum many-body systems, on the other hand, are systems that cannot be fully described using classical mechanics. These systems are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and can exhibit phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. Examples of quantum many-body systems include a gas of quantum particles, a quantum crystal lattice, and a quantum plasma.

In quantum many-body systems, the interactions between particles can be long-ranged and can involve multiple particles. This makes the mean-field approximation less applicable, and more sophisticated methods are required to describe these systems. One such method is density functional theory (DFT), which is a powerful tool for studying the electronic structure of quantum systems.

#### Many-Body Systems in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, many-body systems play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of materials. For example, in metals, the electronic band structure is determined by the interactions between electrons, which can be described using MBT. In quantum systems, phenomena such as superconductivity and topological insulators are also governed by many-body interactions.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of correlation in more detail and discuss how it affects the behavior of many-body systems.




### Subsection 1.1b Statistical Mechanics of Many-Body Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the classical and quantum aspects of many-body systems. In this section, we will explore the statistical mechanics of these systems, which is a crucial aspect of understanding their behavior.

#### Statistical Mechanics of Classical Many-Body Systems

The statistical mechanics of classical many-body systems is typically described using the Boltzmann distribution. This distribution describes the probability of a system being in a particular state, given by the equation:

$$
P(\{x_i\}) = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\sum_i E_i/kT}
$$

where $P(\{x_i\})$ is the probability of the system being in a state described by the set of variables $\{x_i\}$, $Z$ is the partition function, $E_i$ is the energy of the system in state $i$, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

The Boltzmann distribution is derived from the principle of maximum entropy, which states that a system will naturally tend towards the state of highest entropy, or disorder. This principle is often used to derive the equations of motion for classical many-body systems.

#### Statistical Mechanics of Quantum Many-Body Systems

The statistical mechanics of quantum many-body systems is more complex due to the quantum nature of these systems. The wave function of a quantum system describes the probability amplitude of the system being in a particular state, and the Schrödinger equation governs the evolution of this wave function.

The statistical mechanics of quantum systems is often described using the density matrix formalism. The density matrix, $\rho$, is a matrix that describes the state of the system. The diagonal elements of the density matrix, $\rho_{ii}$, give the probability of the system being in state $i$, while the off-diagonal elements, $\rho_{ij}$, give the coherence between states $i$ and $j$.

The density matrix evolves according to the Liouville-von Neumann equation:

$$
i\hbar\frac{d\rho}{dt} = [H, \rho]
$$

where $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $[H, \rho]$ is the commutator of the Hamiltonian and the density matrix.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the many-body theory and discuss how it is used to describe these systems.




### Subsection 1.1c Types of Interactions in Many-Body Systems

In the previous sections, we have discussed the classical and quantum aspects of many-body systems, as well as their statistical mechanics. Now, we will delve into the types of interactions that occur in these systems.

#### Coulomb Interaction

The Coulomb interaction is one of the most fundamental interactions in many-body systems. It describes the interaction between charged particles, and is given by the Coulomb potential:

$$
V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r}
$$

where $V(r)$ is the potential energy, $r$ is the distance between the particles, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges of the particles, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

In many-body systems, the Coulomb interaction can lead to long-range correlations and collective phenomena, such as plasmas and Bose-Einstein condensates.

#### Exchange Interaction

The exchange interaction is another fundamental interaction in many-body systems. It describes the interaction between identical particles, and is a consequence of the antisymmetry principle in quantum mechanics.

The exchange interaction can be understood as a repulsion between identical particles in the same quantum state, and an attraction between identical particles in different quantum states. This interaction is crucial for the stability of matter, and plays a key role in the behavior of fermionic systems.

#### Many-Body Interaction

The many-body interaction is a more general interaction that describes the interaction between any number of particles. It is a consequence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions, and can lead to complex phenomena such as phase transitions and critical points.

The many-body interaction is often described using perturbation theory, where the interaction Hamiltonian is expanded in terms of the one-body operators. This allows us to systematically calculate the effects of the interaction on the system.

In the next section, we will discuss the mathematical techniques used to study these interactions, including perturbation theory and mean-field theory.




### Subsection 1.2a Symmetry and Permutation Operators

In quantum mechanics, the concept of symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of identical particles. Symmetry operations, such as rotations and reflections, can be represented by operators that act on the quantum states of the particles. These operators are known as symmetry operators.

#### Symmetry Operators

Symmetry operators are mathematical objects that represent the symmetry operations in quantum mechanics. They are defined as operators that commute with the Hamiltonian of the system. This means that the symmetry operators do not change the energy of the system, and thus, they are conserved in time.

The symmetry operators can be classified into two types: internal symmetry operators and external symmetry operators. Internal symmetry operators act on the internal degrees of freedom of the particles, such as spin and isospin. External symmetry operators, on the other hand, act on the external degrees of freedom, such as position and momentum.

#### Permutation Operators

Permutation operators are a special type of symmetry operator that act on the permutations of identical particles. They are defined as operators that permute the particles among themselves. For example, in a system of three identical particles, the permutation operator $\hat{P}_{123}$ acts as:

$$
\hat{P}_{123}|\psi(1,2,3)\rangle = |\psi(2,3,1)\rangle
$$

where $|\psi(1,2,3)\rangle$ is the state of the system with particle 1 in state 1, particle 2 in state 2, and particle 3 in state 3.

#### Symmetry and Permutation Operators in Many-Body Systems

In many-body systems, the symmetry and permutation operators play a crucial role in determining the properties of the system. For example, in a system of identical fermions, the permutation operator $\hat{P}_{12}$ acts as:

$$
\hat{P}_{12}|\psi(1,2)\rangle = -\hat{P}_{12}|\psi(1,2)\rangle
$$

due to the antisymmetry principle of fermions. This leads to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state.

In contrast, in a system of identical bosons, the permutation operator $\hat{P}_{12}$ acts as:

$$
\hat{P}_{12}|\psi(1,2)\rangle = \hat{P}_{12}|\psi(1,2)\rangle
$$

due to the symmetry principle of bosons. This leads to the Bose-Einstein condensation, where a large number of bosons can occupy the same quantum state.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of symmetry and permutation operators, and explore their applications in many-body systems.




### Subsection 1.2b Spin and Statistics

In quantum mechanics, the concept of spin is a fundamental property of particles. It is a quantum mechanical property that is analogous to the classical concept of angular momentum, but with some key differences. The spin of a particle is a quantum mechanical property that is intrinsic to the particle, meaning it is not dependent on the external forces acting on the particle. It is also a discrete quantity, unlike classical angular momentum which can take on any value.

#### Spin-1/2 Particles

One of the most well-known examples of spin-1/2 particles is the electron. These particles have a spin of 1/2, meaning they can exist in two states: spin up or spin down. This property is crucial in understanding the behavior of electrons in many-body systems.

#### Spinors

In quantum mechanics, spin is represented by spinors, which are mathematical objects that describe the spin state of a particle. The spinor space is a four-dimensional complex vector space, with basis vectors denoted by $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\sigma_3$, and the identity matrix $\sigma_0$. These basis vectors satisfy the commutation relations:

$$
[\sigma_i, \sigma_j] = 2i \epsilon_{ijk} \sigma_k
$$

where $[\sigma_i, \sigma_j]$ is the commutator of $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_j$, and $\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.

#### Spinors and Rotations

Rotations in quantum mechanics are represented by unitary matrices, which preserve the inner product between vectors. For spin-1/2 particles, the rotation matrices are given by:

$$
R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = \exp\left(\frac{i \alpha \sigma_3}{2}\right) \exp\left(\frac{i \beta \sigma_1}{2}\right) \exp\left(\frac{i \gamma \sigma_2}{2}\right)
$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are the Euler angles defining the rotation. These matrices satisfy the following properties:

$$
R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) R(\alpha', \beta', \gamma') = R(\alpha + \alpha', \beta + \beta', \gamma + \gamma')
$$

$$
R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)^\dagger R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = 1
$$

$$
\det R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = 1
$$

#### Spinors and Statistics

The concept of spin is closely related to the concept of statistics in quantum mechanics. Particles with spin-1/2, such as electrons, are fermions, and follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. This means that they are antisymmetric under particle exchange, and can only occupy states with spin up or spin down. On the other hand, particles with integer spin, such as photons, are bosons and follow Bose-Einstein statistics, which allows them to occupy the same state.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of spinors in more detail and discuss their role in many-body systems.




### Subsection 1.2c Exchange Interaction and Pauli Principle

The Pauli Principle, named after the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle has profound implications for the behavior of many-body systems, particularly in the context of the exchange interaction.

#### Exchange Interaction

The exchange interaction is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that arises due to the indistinguishability of identical particles in quantum mechanics. It is a result of the Pauli Principle, which states that identical particles must be described by antisymmetric wavefunctions. This leads to a repulsive interaction between identical particles in the same quantum state.

The exchange interaction can be understood in terms of the antisymmetry of the wavefunction. If two identical particles are in the same quantum state, the wavefunction describing the system is antisymmetric. This means that if the particles are exchanged, the wavefunction changes sign. This sign change leads to a repulsive interaction between the particles.

#### Pauli Principle and Exchange Interaction

The Pauli Principle has important implications for the exchange interaction. It ensures that the wavefunction describing the system is antisymmetric, leading to a repulsive interaction between identical particles in the same quantum state. This principle is crucial in understanding the behavior of many-body systems, particularly in the context of fermions.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the Pauli Principle and exchange interaction for the behavior of many-body systems. We will also discuss the concept of antisymmetry and its role in quantum mechanics.




### Subsection 1.2d Identical Particles in External Potentials

In the previous sections, we have discussed the quantum mechanics of identical particles and the Pauli Principle. Now, we will explore how these principles apply to identical particles in external potentials.

#### Identical Particles in External Potentials

When identical particles are subjected to an external potential, their behavior is governed by the Schrödinger equation. However, due to the indistinguishability of identical particles, the wavefunction describing the system must be antisymmetric. This leads to the Pauli Principle, which states that identical particles in the same quantum state must be antisymmetric.

The external potential can be represented as a potential energy term in the Schrödinger equation. This potential energy term can be time-dependent or time-independent, depending on the nature of the external potential.

#### Time-Dependent External Potential

In the case of a time-dependent external potential, the Schrödinger equation becomes:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which includes the kinetic energy term and the potential energy term due to the external potential. The wavefunction $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ describes the state of the system at a given time $t$.

The Pauli Principle ensures that the wavefunction remains antisymmetric even in the presence of a time-dependent external potential. This leads to the exchange interaction, which is a repulsive interaction between identical particles in the same quantum state.

#### Time-Independent External Potential

In the case of a time-independent external potential, the Schrödinger equation becomes:

$$
\hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\Psi(\mathbf{r})
$$

where $E$ is the total energy of the system. The wavefunction $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ describes the state of the system at all times.

The Pauli Principle and the exchange interaction still apply in this case. The wavefunction remains antisymmetric, leading to the repulsive interaction between identical particles in the same quantum state.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these principles for many-body systems.




### Subsection 1.3a Slater Determinants

The Slater determinant is a mathematical object that plays a crucial role in the many-body theory of condensed matter systems. It is a wavefunction that describes the state of a system of identical particles, and it is named after the physicist John C. Slater who first introduced it.

#### The Slater Determinant

The Slater determinant is a product of one-body wavefunctions, each of which describes the state of a single particle. Mathematically, it can be written as:

$$
\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_N) = \det(\psi_1(\mathbf{r}_1), \psi_2(\mathbf{r}_2), \ldots, \psi_N(\mathbf{r}_N))
$$

where $\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_N$ are the position vectors of the particles, and $\psi_1(\mathbf{r}_1), \psi_2(\mathbf{r}_2), \ldots, \psi_N(\mathbf{r}_N)$ are the one-body wavefunctions. The determinant is taken over the position vectors of the particles, and it ensures that the wavefunction is antisymmetric under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli Principle.

The Slater determinant is a powerful tool because it allows us to describe the state of a system of identical particles in terms of the one-body wavefunctions of the particles. This is particularly useful in condensed matter systems, where the interactions between particles are often described in terms of one-body potentials.

#### The Slater Determinant and the Antisymmetrizer

The Slater determinant is closely related to the antisymmetrizer, a mathematical object that ensures the antisymmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange. The antisymmetrizer acts on the product of one-body wavefunctions to create the Slater determinant.

In the special case that the wave function to be antisymmetrized is a product of spin-orbitals, the Slater determinant is created by the antisymmetrizer operating on the product of spin-orbitals. This can be seen from the Leibniz formula for determinants, which reads:

$$
\det(\mathbf{B}) = \sum_{\pi \in S_N} (-1)^\pi B_{1,\pi(1)}\cdot B_{2,\pi(2)}\cdot B_{3,\pi(3)}\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot B_{N,\pi(N)}
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the matrix of the one-body wavefunctions, and $\pi$ is a permutation of the particles. The correspondence follows immediately from the Leibniz formula, and it shows that the Slater determinant is indeed an antisymmetric wavefunction.

#### Example

Consider the Slater determinant:

$$
\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \mathbf{r}_3) = \det(\psi_a(\mathbf{r}_1), \psi_b(\mathbf{r}_2), \psi_c(\mathbf{r}_3))
$$

where $\psi_a(\mathbf{r}_1), \psi_b(\mathbf{r}_2), \psi_c(\mathbf{r}_3)$ are the one-body wavefunctions. By the definition of the antisymmetrizer, we have:

$$
\mathcal{A} \psi_a(\mathbf{r}_1)\psi_b(\mathbf{r}_2)\psi_c(\mathbf{r}_3) = \frac{1}{6} \Big( \psi_a(\mathbf{r}_1)\psi_b(\mathbf{r}_2)\psi_c(\mathbf{r}_3) + \psi_a(\mathbf{r}_3)\psi_b(\mathbf{r}_1)\psi_c(\mathbf{r}_2) + \psi_a(\mathbf{r}_2)\psi_b(\mathbf{r}_3)\psi_c(\mathbf{r}_1) \\
-\psi_a(\mathbf{r}_2)\psi_b(\mathbf{r}_1)\psi_c(\mathbf{r}_3) - \psi_a(\mathbf{r}_3)\psi_b(\mathbf{r}_2)\psi_c(\mathbf{r}_1)- \psi_a(\mathbf{r}_1)\psi_b(\mathbf{r}_3)\psi_c(\mathbf{r}_2)\Big)
$$

This shows that the Slater determinant is indeed an antisymmetric wavefunction, as required by the Pauli Principle.

### Subsection 1.3b Hartree-Fock Approximation

The Hartree-Fock approximation is a mean-field theory that is widely used in many-body physics to describe the ground state of a system of identical fermions. It is based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual fields of all the other particles. This approximation is particularly useful in condensed matter systems, where the number of particles is large and the interactions between particles are often described in terms of mean fields.

#### The Hartree-Fock Approximation

The Hartree-Fock approximation is based on the following assumptions:

1. The wavefunction of the system can be written as a single Slater determinant, as discussed in the previous section. This assumption is based on the antisymmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli Principle.

2. The one-body wavefunctions in the Slater determinant are determined by minimizing the total energy of the system. This is achieved by solving the Hartree-Fock equations, which are a set of self-consistent integro-differential equations.

The Hartree-Fock equations can be written as:

$$
\hat{h}_1 \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon_i \psi_i(\mathbf{r})
$$

where $\hat{h}_1$ is the one-body Hamiltonian, $\psi_i(\mathbf{r})$ are the one-body wavefunctions, and $\epsilon_i$ are the one-body energies. The one-body Hamiltonian includes the kinetic energy term and the mean field potential, which is created by the other particles in the system.

#### The Hartree-Fock Approximation and the Antisymmetrizer

The Hartree-Fock approximation is closely related to the antisymmetrizer, as discussed in the previous section. The antisymmetrizer acts on the product of one-body wavefunctions to create the Slater determinant, which is the wavefunction of the system in the Hartree-Fock approximation.

In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the antisymmetrizer is represented by the one-body Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_1$. This is because the one-body Hamiltonian includes the kinetic energy term and the mean field potential, which are both antisymmetric under particle exchange. Therefore, the Hartree-Fock approximation ensures that the wavefunction of the system is antisymmetric under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli Principle.

#### Example

Consider a system of three identical fermions in a one-dimensional box. The one-body Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
\hat{h}_1 = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)
$$

where $V(x)$ is the potential energy due to the box. The one-body wavefunctions are determined by solving the Hartree-Fock equations:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi_i(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \psi_i(x) = \epsilon_i \psi_i(x)
$$

The solution to these equations gives the one-body wavefunctions and the one-body energies, which are used to construct the Slater determinant and the wavefunction of the system.

### Subsection 1.3c Exchange Symmetry

The exchange symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the symmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange. It is closely related to the antisymmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange, as discussed in the previous sections.

#### Exchange Symmetry

The exchange symmetry is a mathematical concept that describes the symmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange. It is based on the principle of indistinguishability of identical particles, which states that the wavefunction of a system of identical particles must be symmetric or antisymmetric under particle exchange.

The exchange symmetry can be represented by the exchange operator $\hat{P}$, which acts on the wavefunction of the system. The exchange operator satisfies the following properties:

1. The exchange operator is unitary, i.e., $\hat{P}^\dagger \hat{P} = 1$.

2. The exchange operator squares to the identity, i.e., $\hat{P}^2 = 1$.

3. The exchange operator commutes with the Hamiltonian of the system, i.e., $[\hat{P}, \hat{H}] = 0$.

These properties ensure that the exchange operator preserves the total energy of the system, which is a constant of motion.

#### Exchange Symmetry and the Antisymmetrizer

The exchange symmetry is closely related to the antisymmetrizer, as discussed in the previous sections. The antisymmetrizer acts on the product of one-body wavefunctions to create the Slater determinant, which is the wavefunction of the system in the Hartree-Fock approximation.

In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the antisymmetrizer is represented by the one-body Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_1$. This is because the one-body Hamiltonian includes the kinetic energy term and the mean field potential, which are both antisymmetric under particle exchange. Therefore, the Hartree-Fock approximation ensures that the wavefunction of the system is antisymmetric under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli Principle.

#### Exchange Symmetry and the Exchange Interaction

The exchange symmetry also plays a crucial role in the exchange interaction, which is a repulsive interaction between identical particles in the same quantum state. The exchange interaction is a consequence of the antisymmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange, as discussed in the previous sections.

The exchange interaction can be represented by the exchange operator $\hat{P}$, which acts on the wavefunction of the system. The exchange interaction is repulsive, i.e., it increases the total energy of the system. This is because the exchange operator changes the sign of the wavefunction under particle exchange, which is equivalent to changing the sign of the total energy.

In the next section, we will discuss the Hartree-Fock approximation in more detail, including its applications and limitations.

### Subsection 1.3d Hund's Rules

Hund's rules are a set of guidelines that describe the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. They are named after the physicist Friedrich Hund, who first proposed them in the 1920s. Hund's rules are based on the Pauli Principle, which states that identical particles in the same quantum state must be antisymmetric.

#### Hund's Rules

Hund's rules can be stated as follows:

1. The ground state of an atom or molecule is a state of maximum multiplicity. The multiplicity of a state is the difference between the number of electrons in the state and the number of electrons in the state with the next highest energy.

2. The ground state of an atom or molecule is a state of maximum spin. The spin of a state is the sum of the spins of the electrons in the state.

3. The ground state of an atom or molecule is a state of maximum orbital angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum of a state is the sum of the orbital angular momenta of the electrons in the state.

These rules are based on the Pauli Principle, which states that identical particles in the same quantum state must be antisymmetric. This means that the wavefunction of the system must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. This is achieved by maximizing the multiplicity, spin, and orbital angular momentum of the state.

#### Hund's Rules and the Antisymmetrizer

The antisymmetrizer plays a crucial role in Hund's rules. The antisymmetrizer acts on the product of one-body wavefunctions to create the Slater determinant, which is the wavefunction of the system in the Hartree-Fock approximation.

In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the antisymmetrizer is represented by the one-body Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_1$. This is because the one-body Hamiltonian includes the kinetic energy term and the mean field potential, which are both antisymmetric under particle exchange. Therefore, the Hartree-Fock approximation ensures that the wavefunction of the system is antisymmetric under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli Principle.

#### Hund's Rules and the Exchange Interaction

The exchange interaction also plays a crucial role in Hund's rules. The exchange interaction is a repulsive interaction between identical particles in the same quantum state. It is a consequence of the antisymmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange, as discussed in the previous sections.

The exchange interaction can be represented by the exchange operator $\hat{P}$, which acts on the wavefunction of the system. The exchange operator changes the sign of the wavefunction under particle exchange, which is equivalent to changing the sign of the total energy. This is why the exchange interaction is repulsive.

In the Hartree-Fock approximation, the exchange interaction is included in the one-body Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_1$. This ensures that the wavefunction of the system is antisymmetric under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli Principle.

### Subsection 1.4a Fermi-Dirac Statistics

Fermi-Dirac statistics is a branch of quantum statistics that describes the behavior of a system of identical fermions.

### Subsection 1.3b Symmetry of Many-Body Wavefunctions

The symmetry of many-body wavefunctions is a crucial aspect of many-body theory. It is closely related to the concept of quantum statistics, which classifies particles into two categories: bosons and fermions. The symmetry of the wavefunction is determined by the quantum statistics of the particles, and it plays a significant role in the behavior of the system.

#### Symmetry and Quantum Statistics

Bosons and fermions are particles that obey the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics, respectively. These statistics are derived from the symmetry properties of the wavefunctions of the particles. 

For bosons, the wavefunction is symmetric under particle exchange, meaning that it remains the same if the particles are exchanged. This is reflected in the Bose-Einstein statistics, which allows for multiple particles to occupy the same quantum state.

On the other hand, for fermions, the wavefunction is antisymmetric under particle exchange, meaning that it changes sign if the particles are exchanged. This is reflected in the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which prohibits multiple particles from occupying the same quantum state.

#### Symmetry and Many-Body Wavefunctions

The symmetry of many-body wavefunctions is determined by the symmetry of the individual wavefunctions of the particles. For a system of identical particles, the wavefunction can be written as a Slater determinant, which is a product of one-body wavefunctions. The symmetry of the Slater determinant is determined by the symmetry of the one-body wavefunctions.

For a system of bosons, the one-body wavefunctions are symmetric under particle exchange, leading to a symmetric Slater determinant. For a system of fermions, the one-body wavefunctions are antisymmetric under particle exchange, leading to an antisymmetric Slater determinant.

#### Symmetry and the Antisymmetrizer

The antisymmetrizer is a mathematical object that ensures the antisymmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange. It acts on the product of one-body wavefunctions to create the Slater determinant. For fermions, the antisymmetrizer is necessary to ensure the antisymmetry of the wavefunction, as required by the Pauli Principle.

In the special case that the wave function to be antisymmetrized is a product of spin-orbitals, the Slater determinant is created by the antisymmetrizer operating on the product of spin-orbitals. This can be seen from the Leibniz formula for determinants, which reads:

$$
\det(\mathbf{B}) = \sum_{\pi \in S_n} \text{sgn}(\pi) \mathbf{B}_{\pi(1),\pi(2),\ldots,\pi(n)}
$$

where $S_n$ is the symmetric group of permutations of $n$ elements, and $\mathbf{B}_{\pi(1),\pi(2),\ldots,\pi(n)}$ is the product of one-body wavefunctions under the permutation $\pi$. The sum is over all permutations $\pi$, and the sign $\text{sgn}(\pi)$ accounts for the sign change under odd permutations, as required by the antisymmetry of the wavefunction.




### Subsection 1.3c Antisymmetrization and Fermionic Wavefunctions

The antisymmetrization of wavefunctions is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, particularly in the study of fermions. It is a mathematical operation that ensures the antisymmetry of the wavefunction under particle exchange, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.

#### The Antisymmetrizer

The antisymmetrizer, denoted as $\mathcal{A}$, is a mathematical operator that acts on the wavefunction of a system of identical particles. It is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{A} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\pi \in S_N} (-1)^\pi \pi,
$$

where $N$ is the number of particles, $S_N$ is the symmetric group of permutations of $N$ objects, and $\pi$ is a permutation. The factor $(-1)^\pi$ accounts for the sign change under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli exclusion principle.

#### Antisymmetrization of Fermionic Wavefunctions

For a system of fermions, the wavefunction is antisymmetric under particle exchange. This means that the wavefunction changes sign if the particles are exchanged. The antisymmetrizer ensures this property by acting on the wavefunction as follows:

$$
\mathcal{A} \Psi(1,2, \ldots, N) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\pi \in S_N} (-1)^\pi \pi \Psi(1,2, \ldots, N),
$$

where $\Psi(1,2, \ldots, N)$ is the wavefunction of the system.

#### Connection with Slater Determinant

In the special case that the wave function to be antisymmetrized is a product of spin-orbitals $\Psi(1,2, \ldots, N) = \psi_{n_1}(1) \psi_{n_2}(2) \cdots \psi_{n_N}(N)$, the Slater determinant is created by the antisymmetrizer operating on the product of spin-orbitals. This correspondence is immediate from the Leibniz formula for determinants, which reads:

$$
\det(\mathbf{B}) = \sum_{\pi \in S_N} (-1)^\pi B_{1,\pi(1)}\cdot B_{2,\pi(2)}\cdot B_{3,\pi(3)}\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot B_{N,\pi(N)},
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the matrix of coefficients. The correspondence follows by noticing that the fermion labels, permuted by the terms in the antisymmetrizer, label different columns (are second indices). The first indices are orbital indices, "n"<sub>1</sub>, ..., "n"<sub>N</sub> labeling the rows.

#### Example

Consider the Slater determinant:

$$
D\equiv
\psi_a(1) & \psi_a(2) & \psi_a(3) \\
\psi_b(1) & \psi_b(2) & \psi_b(3) \\
\psi_c(1) & \psi_c(2) & \psi_c(3)
\end{vmatrix}.
$$

By the definition of the antisymmetrizer, we have:

$$
\mathcal{A} \psi_a(1)\psi_b(2)\psi_c(3) = \frac{1}{6} \Big( \psi_a(1)\psi_b(2)\psi_c(3) + \psi_a(3)\psi_b(1)\psi_c(2) + \psi_a(2)\psi_b(3)\psi_c(1) \\
-\psi_a(2)\psi_b(1)\psi_c(3) - \psi_a(3)\psi_b(2)\psi_c(1)- \psi_a(1)\psi_b(3)\psi_c(2)\Big).
$$

This shows that the antisymmetrizer acts on the wavefunction to ensure its antisymmetry under particle exchange, as required by the Pauli exclusion principle.




### Subsection 1.3d Bosonic and Symplectic Wavefunctions

In the previous sections, we have discussed the antisymmetrization of wavefunctions, particularly focusing on fermions. However, it is equally important to understand the symmetrization of wavefunctions, which is particularly relevant for bosons.

#### The Symmetrizer

The symmetrizer, denoted as $\mathcal{S}$, is a mathematical operator that acts on the wavefunction of a system of identical particles. It is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{S} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\pi \in S_N} (-1)^\pi \pi,
$$

where $N$ is the number of particles, $S_N$ is the symmetric group of permutations of $N$ objects, and $\pi$ is a permutation. The factor $(-1)^\pi$ accounts for the sign change under particle exchange, as required by the Bose-Einstein statistics.

#### Symmetrization of Bosonic Wavefunctions

For a system of bosons, the wavefunction is symmetric under particle exchange. This means that the wavefunction does not change sign if the particles are exchanged. The symmetrizer ensures this property by acting on the wavefunction as follows:

$$
\mathcal{S} \Psi(1,2, \ldots, N) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\pi \in S_N} (-1)^\pi \pi \Psi(1,2, \ldots, N),
$$

where $\Psi(1,2, \ldots, N)$ is the wavefunction of the system.

#### Connection with Symplectic Determinant

In the special case that the wave function to be symmetrized is a product of spin-orbitals $\Psi(1,2, \ldots, N) = \psi_{n_1}(1) \psi_{n_2}(2) \cdots \psi_{n_N}(N)$, the symplectic determinant is created by the symmetrizer operating on the product of spin-orbitals. This correspondence is immediate from the Leibniz formula for determinants, which reads:

$$
\det(\mathbf{B}) = \sum_{\pi \in S_N} (-1)^\pi B_{1,\pi(1)}\cdot B_{2,\pi(2)}\cdot B_{3,\pi(3)}\cdot\,\cdots\,\cdot B_{N,\pi(N)},
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the matrix of coefficients. The correspondence follows by noticing that the fermion labels, permuted by $\pi$, appear in the same order in the product of spin-orbitals.




#### 1.4a Density Matrix and Its Properties

The density matrix, also known as the density operator, is a mathematical object that provides a complete description of a quantum system. It is a generalization of the wavefunction, which is used to describe systems of identical particles. The density matrix is particularly useful in many-body theory, where we often deal with systems of identical particles.

The density matrix, denoted as $\rho$, is defined as:

$$
\rho = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|,
$$

where $p_i$ are the probabilities of the system being in the state $|\psi_i\rangle$, and the sum runs over all possible states of the system. The density matrix is Hermitian and positive-semidefinite, and its trace gives the total probability of the system.

The density matrix has several important properties that make it a powerful tool in quantum mechanics. These properties are:

1. **Completeness:** The density matrix is complete, meaning that it contains all the information about the system. This is reflected in the fact that the trace of the density matrix is equal to the total probability of the system.

2. **Positivity:** The density matrix is positive-semidefinite, meaning that it has non-negative eigenvalues. This is a consequence of the fact that the probability of finding the system in a particular state cannot be negative.

3. **Hermiticity:** The density matrix is Hermitian, meaning that it is equal to its own conjugate transpose. This property is a consequence of the fact that the wavefunction of a system of identical particles is real.

4. **Normalization:** The trace of the density matrix is equal to the total probability of the system. This property ensures that the total probability of the system is conserved.

5. **Reduction of Density Matrix:** If a system is composed of two subsystems, the density matrix of the total system can be reduced to the density matrix of the subsystems. This property is useful in many-body theory, where we often deal with systems composed of multiple subsystems.

In the next section, we will discuss how to calculate the density matrix for a system of identical particles.

In the previous sections, we have discussed the density operator and its role in quantum statistics. Now, we will delve into the concept of entanglement and its relationship with the density operator.

Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described without considering the state of the other particles, even if they are spatially separated. This phenomenon is described mathematically by the density operator.

The density operator, $\rho$, is a matrix that describes the state of a quantum system. It is defined as:

$$
\rho = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|,
$$

where $p_i$ are the probabilities of the system being in the state $|\psi_i\rangle$, and the sum runs over all possible states of the system. The density operator is Hermitian and positive-semidefinite, and its trace gives the total probability of the system.

In the case of entanglement, the density operator becomes more complex. This is because the state of the system cannot be described by a single state vector, but by a superposition of state vectors. The density operator in this case is a matrix that describes the probabilities of finding the system in different states.

The concept of entanglement is closely related to the concept of quantum information. Quantum information theory is a field that studies the principles of quantum information processing, including quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution, quantum teleportation, and quantum computing. The density operator plays a crucial role in this field, as it provides a way to calculate the probabilities of finding the system in different states, which is essential for processing quantum information.

In the next section, we will discuss the properties of the density operator in more detail. We will also discuss how to calculate the density operator for a system of identical particles.

In the realm of quantum physics, the many-body problem is a fundamental challenge that has been studied extensively. This chapter, "Many-Body Perturbation Theory," delves into the intricacies of this problem, providing a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical framework that helps us tackle it.

The many-body problem, as the name suggests, involves systems with a large number of interacting particles. These interactions can be complex and non-linear, making the problem difficult to solve exactly. Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) is a powerful tool that allows us to approximate the solutions to these problems. It is based on the perturbative expansion of the Green's function, a fundamental quantity in quantum physics.

We will also delve into the applications of MBPT in various physical systems, including condensed matter systems and nuclear systems.

The mathematical notation used in this chapter will follow the conventions of quantum physics. For instance, we will use the bra-ket notation for quantum states, and the Green's function will be denoted as $G$. We will also use the popular Markdown format for clarity and ease of understanding.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of many-body perturbation theory and its applications. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the many-body problem and explore more advanced topics.




#### 1.4b Density Operator in Quantum Statistical Mechanics

## Chapter: Many-Body Perturbation Theory

### Introduction

The study of many-body systems is a fundamental aspect of condensed matter physics. These systems, which consist of a large number of interacting particles, are ubiquitous in nature and play a crucial role in various physical phenomena. However, the complexity of these systems often makes it challenging to understand their behavior using analytical methods. This is where many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) comes into play.

MBPT is a powerful mathematical framework that allows us to systematically study the behavior of many-body systems. It is based on the perturbation theory, a method used in quantum mechanics to approximate the behavior of a system when it is subjected to a small perturbation. In the context of many-body systems, the perturbation is typically the interaction between the particles.

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of many-body perturbation theory. We will start by introducing the basic concepts and principles of MBPT, including the mean-field approximation and the Hartree-Fock theory. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as the perturbative expansion and the Feynman diagrams. These concepts will be illustrated with examples and applications in condensed matter systems.

We will also discuss the limitations and challenges of MBPT. Despite its power and versatility, MBPT is not without its shortcomings. For instance, it is often necessary to make certain approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the predictions. We will explore these issues and discuss strategies to mitigate them.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of many-body perturbation theory and its applications in condensed matter systems. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the fascinating world of many-body systems.




#### 1.4c Reduced Density Matrix and Entanglement

In the previous section, we discussed the density operator and its properties. Now, we will delve into the concept of the reduced density matrix and its role in understanding entanglement in quantum systems.

The reduced density matrix, denoted as $\rho_A$, is a key concept in quantum information theory. It provides a way to describe the state of a subsystem of a larger quantum system. The reduced density matrix is obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the complementary subsystem.

Mathematically, the reduced density matrix is defined as:

$$
\rho_A = \text{Tr}_B \rho,
$$

where $\rho$ is the density operator of the total system, and $\text{Tr}_B$ denotes the trace over the degrees of freedom of the complementary subsystem $B$.

The reduced density matrix has several important properties that make it a useful tool in quantum information theory. These properties are:

1. **Completeness:** The reduced density matrix is complete, meaning that it contains all the information about the subsystem $A$. This is reflected in the fact that the trace of the reduced density matrix is equal to the total probability of the subsystem.

2. **Positivity:** The reduced density matrix is positive-semidefinite, meaning that it has non-negative eigenvalues. This is a consequence of the fact that the probability of finding the subsystem in a particular state cannot be negative.

3. **Hermiticity:** The reduced density matrix is Hermitian, meaning that it is equal to its own conjugate transpose. This property is a consequence of the fact that the wavefunction of a system of identical particles is real.

4. **Normalization:** The trace of the reduced density matrix is equal to the total probability of the subsystem. This property ensures that the total probability of the subsystem is conserved.

The reduced density matrix plays a crucial role in understanding entanglement in quantum systems. Entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described without considering the state of the other particles. The reduced density matrix provides a way to quantify this entanglement.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of entanglement in more detail and explore its implications for quantum information theory.




#### 1.4d Time Evolution of Density Operator

The density operator, as we have seen, provides a complete description of the state of a quantum system. However, the state of a system can change over time, and it is important to understand how the density operator evolves.

The time evolution of the density operator is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation describes how the wavefunction of a quantum system changes over time. The wavefunction, in turn, is related to the density operator through the equation:

$$
\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|,
$$

where $|\psi\rangle$ is the wavefunction of the system.

The Schrödinger equation can be written in the interaction picture, where the Hamiltonian is split into two parts: the free Hamiltonian $H_0$ and the interaction Hamiltonian $H_I$. The interaction picture Schrödinger equation is given by:

$$
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}|\psi_I\rangle = H_I|\psi_I\rangle,
$$

where $|\psi_I\rangle$ is the interaction picture wavefunction.

The density operator in the interaction picture, denoted as $\rho_I$, evolves according to the equation:

$$
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}\rho_I = [H_I, \rho_I].
$$

This equation describes the time evolution of the density operator due to the interaction Hamiltonian. It is important to note that the density operator is not affected by the free Hamiltonian $H_0$, as it acts on the wavefunction in the same way for all states.

The time evolution of the density operator is a crucial concept in many-body theory. It allows us to understand how the state of a quantum system changes over time due to interactions between particles. This is particularly important in condensed matter systems, where the interactions between particles can lead to complex phenomena such as phase transitions and criticality.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of the density operator and its properties, and explore how it can be used to understand the behavior of many-body systems.




#### 1.5a Two-Point Green's Functions

Green's functions, also known as propagators, are fundamental objects in quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics. They provide a mathematical description of the propagation of quantum states, such as wavefunctions or density operators, from one point in space and time to another. In the context of many-body theory, Green's functions are particularly useful as they allow us to describe the collective behavior of a system of interacting particles.

The two-point Green's function, also known as the retarded Green's function, is a specific type of Green's function that describes the propagation of a quantum state from one point to another in space and time. It is defined as the inverse of the operator $G_0^{-1}$, where $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function. The two-point Green's function is denoted as $G^R(x,x')$, where $x$ and $x'$ are points in space and time.

The two-point Green's function satisfies the following equation:

$$
G^R(x,x') = -i\theta(t-t')\langle\{c(x), c^\dagger(x')\}\rangle,
$$

where $c(x)$ and $c^\dagger(x)$ are the annihilation and creation operators for a particle at point $x$, $t$ and $t'$ are the times at which the operators act, and $\theta(t-t')$ is the Heaviside step function. The brackets denote the expectation value in the ground state of the system.

The two-point Green's function plays a crucial role in many-body theory. It encapsulates the information about the propagation of a quantum state in a system of interacting particles. It is particularly useful in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena, where it allows us to understand the collective behavior of the system.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of the two-point Green's function and explore its applications in many-body theory.

#### 1.5b Dyson's Equation

Dyson's equation is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics that provides a recursive method to calculate the Green's function of a system. It is named after the British physicist Freeman Dyson, who first derived it in the 1940s.

Dyson's equation relates the Green's function $G$ of a system to the self-energy $\Sigma$, which accounts for the interactions between the particles in the system. The equation is given by:

$$
G = G_0 + G_0\Sigma G,
$$

where $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function. This equation can be iterated to obtain a series expansion for the Green's function in terms of the self-energy.

The self-energy $\Sigma$ is a complex quantity that accounts for the interactions between the particles in the system. It is defined as the sum of the one-particle irreducible (1PI) diagrams in perturbation theory. The 1PI diagrams are those that cannot be split into two disjoint subdiagrams by cutting a single line.

Dyson's equation is a powerful tool in many-body theory. It allows us to calculate the Green's function of a system, which encapsulates the information about the propagation of a quantum state in the system. This is particularly useful in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena, where the Green's function provides insights into the collective behavior of the system.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of the Green's function and the self-energy, and discuss their implications for the behavior of a many-body system.

#### 1.5c Analytic Properties of Green's Functions

The analytic properties of Green's functions are crucial in understanding the behavior of many-body systems. They provide insights into the spectral properties of the system, which are related to the energy levels of the particles in the system.

The Green's function $G$ is a complex quantity, and its analytic properties depend on the nature of the self-energy $\Sigma$. If the self-energy is analytic in the upper half-plane of the complex frequency plane, then the Green's function is also analytic in the upper half-plane. This is known as the Kramers-Kronig relation.

The Green's function also has poles in the complex frequency plane, which correspond to the energy levels of the particles in the system. The residues of these poles provide the amplitudes of the particles at these energy levels.

The analytic properties of the Green's function can be studied using the method of analytic continuation. This involves extending the Green's function from the real frequency axis to the complex frequency plane. The Green's function can be analytically continued to the complex frequency plane by using the Dyson equation.

The analytic properties of the Green's function are closely related to the properties of the self-energy. For example, if the self-energy has a branch cut in the complex frequency plane, then the Green's function also has a branch cut. This is known as the Landau-Zener formula.

The analytic properties of the Green's function are also related to the properties of the spectral function $A$, which is defined as the imaginary part of the Green's function. The spectral function provides information about the spectral density of the system, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given energy level.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of the spectral function and its relation to the Green's function. We will also discuss the implications of these properties for the behavior of many-body systems.

#### 1.5d Green's Functions in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, Green's functions play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of many-body systems. They provide a mathematical framework for describing the propagation of quantum states in a system of interacting particles.

The Green's function $G$ in condensed matter physics is defined as the inverse of the one-particle Hamiltonian $H$:

$$
G = (E - H)^{-1},
$$

where $E$ is the energy of the system. This definition allows us to calculate the propagation of a quantum state from one point in space and time to another.

The Green's function in condensed matter physics also has a spectral representation, which is given by the Dyson equation:

$$
G = G_0 + G_0\Sigma G,
$$

where $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function, and $\Sigma$ is the self-energy. The self-energy accounts for the interactions between the particles in the system.

The spectral representation of the Green's function provides insights into the spectral properties of the system. The poles of the Green's function correspond to the energy levels of the particles in the system. The residues of these poles provide the amplitudes of the particles at these energy levels.

The analytic properties of the Green's function in condensed matter physics are closely related to the properties of the self-energy. For example, if the self-energy has a branch cut in the complex frequency plane, then the Green's function also has a branch cut. This is known as the Landau-Zener formula.

The Green's function in condensed matter physics is also related to the spectral function $A$, which is defined as the imaginary part of the Green's function. The spectral function provides information about the spectral density of the system, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given energy level.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of the spectral function and its relation to the Green's function in more detail. We will also discuss the implications of these properties for the behavior of many-body systems in condensed matter physics.

## Chapter: Many-Body Perturbation Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of condensed matter physics, the many-body perturbation theory is a fundamental concept that provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of systems with a large number of interacting particles. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of this theory, exploring its principles, applications, and the mathematical formalism that underpins it.

The many-body perturbation theory is a powerful tool that allows us to study the effects of interactions between particles in a system. It is particularly useful in condensed matter physics, where systems often consist of a large number of interacting particles. The theory provides a systematic way to calculate the effects of these interactions, starting from a non-interacting system and gradually introducing the interactions.

The mathematical formalism of the many-body perturbation theory involves the use of Green's functions, which provide a way to describe the propagation of particles in a system. These Green's functions are defined in terms of the one-body Green's function, which describes the propagation of a single particle in the presence of a mean field. The many-body Green's function is then obtained by iterating the one-body Green's function.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of the many-body perturbation theory in detail, starting from the definition of the one-body Green's function and proceeding to the definition of the many-body Green's function. We will also discuss the applications of this theory in condensed matter physics, including its use in studying phase transitions and critical phenomena.

The mathematical formalism of the many-body perturbation theory can be quite complex, involving the use of multiple indices and summations. However, we will strive to present this material in a clear and accessible manner, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a clear and understandable way.

In conclusion, the many-body perturbation theory is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of systems with a large number of interacting particles. By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of this theory and its applications in condensed matter physics.




#### 1.5b Spectral Functions and Density of States

The spectral function, denoted as $A(\omega)$, is a crucial concept in the study of many-body systems. It is a function that describes the distribution of energy eigenstates of a system in the energy domain. The spectral function is particularly useful in the study of Green's functions, as it allows us to express the Green's function in terms of the spectral function.

The spectral function is defined as the imaginary part of the Green's function, i.e.,

$$
A(\omega) = \Im G(\omega),
$$

where $G(\omega)$ is the Green's function. The spectral function is a complex-valued function, and its real and imaginary parts are related to the density of states and the phase of the Green's function, respectively.

The density of states, $N(\omega)$, is another important concept in the study of many-body systems. It is a function that describes the number of energy eigenstates of a system in a given energy range. The density of states is particularly useful in the study of Green's functions, as it allows us to express the Green's function in terms of the density of states.

The density of states is defined as the derivative of the spectral function with respect to energy, i.e.,

$$
N(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{dA(\omega)}{d\omega}.
$$

The density of states is a real-valued function, and its value at a given energy $\omega$ gives the number of energy eigenstates of the system in the energy range $[\omega, \omega + d\omega]$.

The spectral function and the density of states are closely related. In fact, the spectral function can be expressed in terms of the density of states as

$$
A(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi} N(\omega) \Im G(\omega).
$$

This equation shows that the spectral function is proportional to the product of the density of states and the imaginary part of the Green's function. This relationship is fundamental in the study of many-body systems, as it allows us to express the Green's function in terms of the spectral function and the density of states.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of the spectral function and the density of states in more detail. We will also discuss how these concepts are used in the study of many-body systems.

#### 1.5c Green's Functions in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, Green's functions play a crucial role in the study of many-body systems. They provide a mathematical framework for describing the propagation of quantum states in a system of interacting particles. In this section, we will explore the application of Green's functions in condensed matter physics, focusing on the concept of spectral functions and density of states.

The spectral function, $A(\omega)$, is a key concept in the study of Green's functions in condensed matter physics. It describes the distribution of energy eigenstates of a system in the energy domain. The spectral function is particularly useful in the study of Green's functions, as it allows us to express the Green's function in terms of the spectral function.

The spectral function is defined as the imaginary part of the Green's function, i.e.,

$$
A(\omega) = \Im G(\omega),
$$

where $G(\omega)$ is the Green's function. The spectral function is a complex-valued function, and its real and imaginary parts are related to the density of states and the phase of the Green's function, respectively.

The density of states, $N(\omega)$, is another important concept in the study of many-body systems. It describes the number of energy eigenstates of a system in a given energy range. The density of states is particularly useful in the study of Green's functions, as it allows us to express the Green's function in terms of the density of states.

The density of states is defined as the derivative of the spectral function with respect to energy, i.e.,

$$
N(\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{dA(\omega)}{d\omega}.
$$

The density of states is a real-valued function, and its value at a given energy $\omega$ gives the number of energy eigenstates of the system in the energy range $[\omega, \omega + d\omega]$.

In condensed matter physics, the spectral function and the density of states are used to study the electronic band structure of materials. The spectral function provides information about the energy eigenstates of the electrons in the material, while the density of states gives the number of these states in a given energy range. This information is crucial for understanding the electronic properties of materials, such as their conductivity and magnetism.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of the spectral function and the density of states, and explore how they are used in the study of many-body systems in condensed matter physics.

## Chapter: Many-Body Perturbation Theory

### Introduction

The study of many-body systems is a fundamental aspect of condensed matter physics. These systems, which consist of a large number of interacting particles, are ubiquitous in nature and play a crucial role in various physical phenomena. However, the complexity of these systems often makes it challenging to understand their properties and behavior. This is where many-body perturbation theory comes into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of many-body perturbation theory, a powerful mathematical tool used to study many-body systems. This theory is based on the perturbative expansion of the Green's function, a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics that describes the propagation of particles in a system. The Green's function is a key component in the calculation of various physical quantities, such as the density of states, the spectral function, and the self-energy of the particles.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of many-body perturbation theory, including the Green's function and the self-energy. We will then proceed to discuss the perturbative expansion of the Green's function, which allows us to systematically calculate the effects of interactions between particles. This expansion is based on the assumption that the interactions between particles are weak and can be treated as a small perturbation to the non-interacting system.

Next, we will explore the applications of many-body perturbation theory in various physical systems, such as metals, insulators, and quantum gases. We will also discuss the limitations of this theory and its extensions, such as the random phase approximation and the density functional theory.

Finally, we will conclude this chapter by discussing the future prospects of many-body perturbation theory and its potential for further advancements in the study of many-body systems. We hope that this chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to many-body perturbation theory and its applications, and inspire readers to delve deeper into this fascinating field.




#### 1.5c Kubo Formula and Response Functions

The Kubo formula is a fundamental result in linear response theory, which provides a method to calculate the response of a system to an external perturbation. It is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, as it allows us to express the response of the system in terms of the Green's function.

The Kubo formula is given by

$$
\chi (\omega) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega' \frac{A(\omega')}{\omega - \omega' + i\delta},
$$

where $\chi (\omega)$ is the response function, $A(\omega')$ is the spectral function, and $\delta$ is a small positive number. The response function is a complex-valued function, and its real and imaginary parts are related to the susceptibility and the phase of the Green's function, respectively.

The response function is defined as the inverse of the Green's function, i.e.,

$$
\chi (\omega) = G^{-1} (\omega).
$$

The response function is a complex-valued function, and its real and imaginary parts are related to the susceptibility and the phase of the Green's function, respectively.

The Kubo formula is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, as it allows us to express the response of the system in terms of the spectral function. This is because the spectral function contains all the information about the energy eigenstates of the system, and the response function is a measure of how these eigenstates respond to an external perturbation.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of the Kubo formula in the study of many-body systems.




#### 1.5d Diagrammatic Techniques for Green's Functions

In the previous sections, we have discussed the Green's function and its properties. We have also introduced the Kubo formula, which provides a method to calculate the response of a system to an external perturbation. In this section, we will introduce diagrammatic techniques for Green's functions, which are powerful tools for visualizing and calculating Green's functions.

Diagrammatic techniques for Green's functions are based on the concept of Feynman diagrams, which were first introduced by Richard Feynman in the 1940s. Feynman diagrams are graphical representations of quantum mechanical processes, where particles are represented by lines and interactions between particles are represented by vertices.

In the context of many-body theory, Feynman diagrams are used to represent the Green's function. The Green's function is represented by a line, and the interactions between particles are represented by vertices. The Green's function is calculated by summing over all possible Feynman diagrams.

The diagrammatic techniques for Green's functions are particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, as they allow us to express the Green's function in terms of the interaction between particles. This is because the Green's function is a measure of how a particle responds to an external perturbation, and the interaction between particles is the source of this perturbation.

The diagrammatic techniques for Green's functions are also closely related to the Kubo formula. The Kubo formula can be represented as a Feynman diagram, where the response function is represented by a line and the spectral function is represented by a vertex. This representation allows us to express the Kubo formula in terms of the Green's function, and to calculate the response of the system to an external perturbation.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of diagrammatic techniques for Green's functions in the study of many-body systems.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of many-body theory and its importance in understanding the behavior of condensed matter systems. We discussed how the interactions between a large number of particles can lead to complex and interesting phenomena, and how many-body theory provides a powerful framework for studying these phenomena. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formalism of many-body theory, specifically focusing on second quantization.

Second quantization is a powerful mathematical tool that allows us to describe the behavior of a large number of particles in a more concise and elegant manner. It is based on the concept of creation and annihilation operators, which allow us to create and destroy particles in a given state. This formalism is particularly useful in condensed matter systems, where we often deal with a large number of particles and their interactions.

In this chapter, we will first introduce the basic concepts of second quantization, including creation and annihilation operators, and the concept of Fock space. We will then explore how these concepts can be applied to different types of condensed matter systems, such as fermionic and bosonic systems. We will also discuss the concept of occupation numbers and how they relate to the behavior of particles in a system.

Finally, we will touch upon some of the applications of second quantization in condensed matter physics, such as the Hubbard model and the BCS theory. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of second quantization, and how it can be extended to more complex systems.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of second quantization and its importance in the study of condensed matter systems. They will also have the necessary tools to apply this formalism to their own research and understanding of these complex systems. So let us begin our journey into the world of second quantization and its applications in condensed matter physics.




### Section: 2.1 Occupation Number Representation

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of many-body theory and its importance in understanding the behavior of condensed matter systems. We discussed how the interactions between a large number of particles can lead to complex and interesting phenomena, and how many-body theory provides a powerful framework for studying these phenomena. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formalism of many-body theory, specifically focusing on the occupation number representation.

The occupation number representation is a powerful mathematical tool that allows us to describe the behavior of a large number of particles in a more concise and elegant manner. It is based on the concept of occupation numbers, which represent the number of particles in a given state. This formalism is particularly useful in condensed matter systems, where we often deal with a large number of particles and their interactions.

To understand the occupation number representation, we first need to introduce the concept of Fock space. Fock space is a mathematical space that represents all possible states of a system of particles. It is defined as the tensor product of the single-particle Hilbert space with itself, and is denoted as $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{H})$. In other words, Fock space is a space of all possible states of a system of particles, where each state is represented by a tensor product of single-particle states.

The occupation number representation is a basis for Fock space, and it is defined as the set of all possible occupation numbers for each single-particle state. In other words, the occupation number representation is a set of vectors in Fock space, where each vector represents a specific set of occupation numbers for each single-particle state. This representation is particularly useful because it allows us to describe the state of a system of particles in a more concise and elegant manner.

The occupation number representation is closely related to the concept of creation and annihilation operators, which are mathematical operators that allow us to create and destroy particles in a given state. These operators are defined as follows:

$$
a_i^\dagger |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i+1} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i+1, \ldots\rangle
$$

$$
a_i |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i-1, \ldots\rangle
$$

where $n_i$ is the occupation number of the $i$th single-particle state, and $a_i^\dagger$ and $a_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the $i$th single-particle state, respectively. These operators satisfy the following commutation relations:

$$
[a_i, a_j^\dagger] = \delta_{ij}
$$

$$
[a_i, a_j] = [a_i^\dagger, a_j^\dagger] = 0
$$

where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to 1 if $i=j$ and 0 otherwise. These commutation relations are crucial for understanding the behavior of creation and annihilation operators, and they will be used extensively in the following sections.

In the next section, we will explore how the occupation number representation can be applied to different types of condensed matter systems, such as fermionic and bosonic systems. We will also discuss the concept of occupation numbers and how they relate to the behavior of particles in a system. Finally, we will touch upon some of the applications of second quantization in condensed matter physics, such as the Hubbard model and the BCS theory.





### Subsection: 2.1b Occupation Number Operators

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of occupation numbers and how they are represented in Fock space. In this section, we will explore the operators that act on these occupation numbers, known as occupation number operators.

Occupation number operators are mathematical objects that act on the occupation numbers in Fock space. They are defined as the number operators for each single-particle state, and are denoted as $a^\dagger_i$ and $a_i$, where $i$ represents the single-particle state. These operators have the following properties:

$$
a^\dagger_i a_i = 1
$$

$$
a^\dagger_i a^\dagger_j = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j
$$

$$
a_i a_j = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j
$$

These operators also satisfy the following commutation relations:

$$
[a_i, a^\dagger_j] = \delta_{ij}
$$

$$
[a_i, a_j] = [a^\dagger_i, a^\dagger_j] = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j
$$

These operators are crucial in many-body theory as they allow us to manipulate the occupation numbers in Fock space. For example, the creation operator $a^\dagger_i$ increases the occupation number by one, while the annihilation operator $a_i$ decreases the occupation number by one. These operators also allow us to create and destroy particles in a given state, which is essential in understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

In addition to the creation and annihilation operators, there are also other important occupation number operators, such as the number operator $N_i = a^\dagger_i a_i$ and the occupation number operator $n_i = a^\dagger_i a_i$. These operators are particularly useful in studying the statistical properties of particles in a system, as they allow us to calculate the average number of particles in a given state.

In summary, occupation number operators are essential mathematical objects in many-body theory that allow us to manipulate the occupation numbers in Fock space. They are crucial in understanding the behavior of many-body systems and are defined as the number operators for each single-particle state.

### Subsection: 2.1c Occupation Number Algebra

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of occupation number operators and their properties. In this section, we will explore the algebraic structure of these operators and how they relate to the occupation numbers in Fock space.

The occupation number operators, $a^\dagger_i$ and $a_i$, satisfy certain algebraic relations that are crucial in understanding the behavior of many-body systems. These relations are known as the canonical commutation relations and are given by:

$$
[a_i, a_j] = [a^\dagger_i, a^\dagger_j] = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j
$$

$$
[a_i, a^\dagger_j] = \delta_{ij}
$$

These relations can be used to derive important properties of the occupation number operators, such as:

$$
a^\dagger_i a_i = 1
$$

$$
a^\dagger_i a^\dagger_j = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j
$$

$$
a_i a_j = 0 \text{ for } i \neq j
$$

These properties are crucial in understanding the behavior of the occupation numbers in Fock space. For example, the property $a^\dagger_i a_i = 1$ tells us that the occupation number of a single-particle state can only take on the values of 0 or 1. This is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state.

The properties of the occupation number operators also allow us to define important operators, such as the number operator $N_i = a^\dagger_i a_i$ and the occupation number operator $n_i = a^\dagger_i a_i$. These operators are particularly useful in studying the statistical properties of particles in a system, as they allow us to calculate the average number of particles in a given state.

In summary, the occupation number operators and their properties play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of many-body systems. They allow us to manipulate the occupation numbers in Fock space and define important operators that are essential in studying the statistical properties of particles in a system.

### Section: 2.2 Creation and Annihilation Operators:

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of second quantization and its importance in understanding the behavior of many-body systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical representation of second quantization, specifically focusing on the creation and annihilation operators.

#### 2.2a Creation and Annihilation Operators in Occupation Number Representation

The creation and annihilation operators, denoted by $a^\dagger$ and $a$, respectively, are fundamental operators in second quantization. They are used to create and destroy particles in a given quantum state, and their commutation relations are crucial in understanding the statistical behavior of particles.

In the occupation number representation, the creation and annihilation operators take on a matrix form. For a quantum harmonic oscillator with a set of orthonormal basis vectors $\{\psi_i\}$, the matrix representation of the creation and annihilation operators is given by

$$
a^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots \\
\sqrt{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots \\
0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots \\
0 & 0 & \sqrt{3} & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \dots & \dots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & \sqrt{n} & 0 & \dots & \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
a = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \sqrt{1} & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots \\
0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \dots & 0 & \dots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{3} & \dots & 0 & \dots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots & \vdots & \dots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \sqrt{n} & \dots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \ddots \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

These matrices can be obtained by calculating the matrix elements of the creation and annihilation operators with respect to the basis vectors $\{\psi_i\}$. The eigenvectors $\psi_i$ are those of the quantum harmonic oscillator and are sometimes referred to as the "number basis".

The creation and annihilation operators also have important properties that are crucial in understanding the behavior of many-body systems. For example, they satisfy the following commutation relations:

$$
[a,a^\dagger] = 1
$$

$$
[a,a] = [a^\dagger,a^\dagger] = 0
$$

These commutation relations are crucial in understanding the statistical behavior of particles, as they determine whether the particles are bosons or fermions. Bosons have integer spin and satisfy Bose-Einstein statistics, while fermions have half-integer spin and satisfy Fermi-Dirac statistics.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of second quantization in more detail, specifically focusing on the creation and annihilation operators and their role in understanding the behavior of many-body systems.


## Chapter 2: Second Quantization:




#### 2.2b Algebra of Creation and Annihilation Operators

The algebra of creation and annihilation operators is a fundamental concept in second quantization. It is the mathematical framework that governs the behavior of these operators and their commutation relations.

The algebra of creation and annihilation operators is defined by the following relations:

$$
[a,a^\dagger] = 1
$$

$$
[a,a] = [a^\dagger,a^\dagger] = 0
$$

where $[A,B]$ denotes the commutator of operators $A$ and $B$. These relations are known as the canonical commutation relations.

The first relation, $[a,a^\dagger] = 1$, states that the creation and annihilation operators satisfy a canonical anticommutation relation. This is a key property that allows us to interpret the creation and annihilation operators as the creation and annihilation of particles.

The second relation, $[a,a] = [a^\dagger,a^\dagger] = 0$, states that the creation and annihilation operators commute with themselves. This is a consequence of the fact that these operators act on different parts of the quantum state.

The algebra of creation and annihilation operators is closely related to the CCR (canonical commutation relation) algebra and the CAR (canonical anticommutation relation) algebra. These algebras are abstractly generated by elements $a(f)$ and $a^\dagger(f)$, where $f$ ranges freely over the one-particle Hilbert space $H$. The map $f\to a^\dagger(f)$ is complex linear, and its adjoint is $f\to a(f)$.

The CCR algebra is closely related, but not identical, to a Weyl algebra. Similarly, the CAR algebra is closely related, but not identical, to a Clifford algebra.

In the next section, we will explore the physical interpretation of the creation and annihilation operators and their role in the statistical behavior of particles.

#### 2.2c Creation and Annihilation Operators in Quantum Statistics

In quantum statistics, the creation and annihilation operators play a crucial role in describing the behavior of particles. These operators are particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where they allow us to describe the collective behavior of a large number of particles.

The creation and annihilation operators are defined as follows:

$$
a^\dagger(f) = \sqrt{n+1} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( f + a^\dagger \cdot f \right)
$$

$$
a(f) = \sqrt{n+1} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( f + a \cdot f \right)
$$

where $n$ is the number of particles in the system, and $a^\dagger$ and $a$ are the creation and annihilation operators, respectively. These operators satisfy the canonical commutation relations, as discussed in the previous section.

The creation and annihilation operators are particularly useful in the study of quantum statistics because they allow us to describe the collective behavior of a large number of particles. For example, the number operator $N = a^\dagger \cdot a$ counts the number of particles in the system. The commutation relations between the creation and annihilation operators also allow us to derive important results about the statistical behavior of particles.

In the next section, we will explore the physical interpretation of the creation and annihilation operators and their role in the statistical behavior of particles.




#### 2.2c Fermionic and Bosonic Operators

In quantum statistics, particles are classified into two types: fermions and bosons. The creation and annihilation operators for these particles are also different. 

##### Fermionic Operators

Fermions are particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. The creation and annihilation operators for fermions are defined as follows:

$$
a_i^\dagger |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i + 1} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i + 1, \ldots\rangle
$$

$$
a_i |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i - 1, \ldots\rangle
$$

where $n_i$ is the occupation number of the $i$-th single-particle state, and $|n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle$ is a state with $n_1$ particles in the first single-particle state, $n_2$ particles in the second single-particle state, and so on.

##### Bosonic Operators

Bosons are particles that do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The creation and annihilation operators for bosons are defined as follows:

$$
b_i^\dagger |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i + 1} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i + 1, \ldots\rangle
$$

$$
b_i |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i - 1, \ldots\rangle
$$

where $n_i$ is the occupation number of the $i$-th single-particle state, and $|n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle$ is a state with $n_1$ particles in the first single-particle state, $n_2$ particles in the second single-particle state, and so on.

The key difference between fermionic and bosonic operators is the square root factor in the annihilation operator. This factor leads to different statistical behaviors for fermions and bosons. For fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle ensures that the number of particles in each single-particle state is either 0 or 1, leading to a discrete spectrum of energy levels. For bosons, the occupation numbers can be larger than 1, leading to a continuous spectrum of energy levels.

In the next section, we will explore the physical interpretation of these operators and their role in quantum statistics.




#### 2.2d Number Operators and Their Properties

In the previous sections, we have introduced the creation and annihilation operators for fermions and bosons. These operators are fundamental to the second quantization formalism and are used to create and destroy particles in a given quantum state. However, it is also important to understand the number operators, which are used to count the number of particles in a given state.

##### Number Operators

The number operator for a particle in a given state $|n\rangle$ is defined as:

$$
\hat{n} = a^\dagger a
$$

for bosons, and

$$
\hat{n} = b^\dagger b
$$

for fermions. Here, $a^\dagger$ and $a$ are the creation and annihilation operators for bosons, and $b^\dagger$ and $b$ are the creation and annihilation operators for fermions.

The number operator has the following properties:

1. It is Hermitian, i.e., $\hat{n} = \hat{n}^\dagger$.
2. It is positive semi-definite, i.e., $\hat{n} \geq 0$.
3. For bosons, the number operator is equal to the sum of the creation and annihilation operators, i.e., $\hat{n} = a^\dagger a$.
4. For fermions, the number operator is equal to the difference of the creation and annihilation operators, i.e., $\hat{n} = b^\dagger b$.

##### Commutation Relations

The number operator also satisfies the following commutation relations:

1. For bosons, the number operator commutes with the creation and annihilation operators, i.e., $[\hat{n}, a^\dagger] = [\hat{n}, a] = 0$.
2. For fermions, the number operator anticommutes with the creation and annihilation operators, i.e., $[\hat{n}, b^\dagger] = [\hat{n}, b] = 0$.

These commutation relations are crucial in the second quantization formalism, as they allow us to express the Hamiltonian of a many-body system in terms of the creation and annihilation operators. This is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where the number of particles can change due to particle creation and annihilation processes.

In the next section, we will discuss the properties of the number operator in more detail, and explore its implications for the behavior of many-body systems.

#### 2.2e Creation and Annihilation Operators in Quantum Statistics

In the previous sections, we have introduced the creation and annihilation operators for fermions and bosons. These operators are fundamental to the second quantization formalism and are used to create and destroy particles in a given quantum state. However, it is also important to understand how these operators behave in the context of quantum statistics.

##### Quantum Statistics

Quantum statistics refers to the statistical behavior of a system of identical particles. The behavior of these particles is governed by the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions and the Bose-Einstein statistics for bosons. These statistics are fundamental to the behavior of many-body systems and are crucial in the study of quantum mechanics.

##### Creation and Annihilation Operators in Quantum Statistics

The creation and annihilation operators for fermions and bosons are defined as follows:

$$
a^\dagger |n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1} |n+1\rangle

#### 2.3a Fock Space and Its Basis States

The Fock space, denoted as $F_\nu(H)$, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, particularly in the study of many-body systems. It is a direct sum of tensor products of copies of a single-particle Hilbert space $H$. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
F_\nu(H) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty} S_\nu H^{\otimes n}
$$

Here, $S_\nu$ is the symmetrization operator for identical particles, and $H^{\otimes n}$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $H$. The Fock space is a complex vector space, and its basis states are the states of $n$ identical particles, where $n$ can be 0, 1, 2, ...

The general state of the Fock space is given by:

$$
|\Psi\rangle_\nu = |\Psi_0\rangle_\nu \oplus |\Psi_1\rangle_\nu \oplus |\Psi_2\rangle_\nu \oplus \cdots
$$

where $|\Psi_n\rangle_\nu$ are the states of $n$ particles. The convergence of this infinite sum is crucial for the Fock space to be a Hilbert space. Technically, we require the Fock space to be the Hilbert space completion of the algebraic direct sum. It consists of all infinite tuples $|\Psi\rangle_\nu = (|\Psi_0\rangle_\nu , |\Psi_1\rangle_\nu , |\Psi_2\rangle_\nu, \ldots)$ such that the norm, defined by the inner product, is finite:

$$
\| |\Psi\rangle_\nu \|_\nu^2 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \langle \Psi_n |\Psi_n \rangle_\nu < \infty
$$

The norm on the tensor product $H^{\otimes n}$ is defined by:

$$
\langle \Psi_n | \Psi_n \rangle_\nu = \sum_{i_1,\ldots i_n, j_1, \ldots j_n} a_{i_1,\ldots, i_n}^* a_{j_1, \ldots, j_n} \langle \psi_{i_1}| \psi_{j_1} \rangle\cdots \langle \psi_{i_n}| \psi_{j_n} \rangle
$$

The Fock space provides a convenient mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles. It is particularly useful in quantum statistics, where the states of identical particles are classified into two types: bosons and fermions. The Fock space is used to construct the wave functions of these particles, and it plays a crucial role in the second quantization formalism.

#### 2.3b Fock Space and Its Physical Interpretation

The Fock space, as we have seen, is a complex vector space that provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles. However, it also has a physical interpretation that is crucial to understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

The physical interpretation of the Fock space is rooted in the concept of quantum statistics. As we have discussed, the states of identical particles are classified into two types: bosons and fermions. The Fock space is used to construct the wave functions of these particles, and it plays a crucial role in the second quantization formalism.

For bosons, the Fock space is used to construct the wave functions of the particles in the ground state and excited states. The ground state wave function, denoted as $|\Psi_0\rangle_\nu$, represents the state of the system when all the particles are in the lowest energy state. The excited states, represented by $|\Psi_n\rangle_\nu$ for $n > 0$, represent the states of the system when some of the particles are in higher energy states.

For fermions, the Fock space is used to construct the wave functions of the particles in the ground state and excited states. The ground state wave function, denoted as $|\Psi_0\rangle_\nu$, represents the state of the system when all the particles are in the lowest energy state. The excited states, represented by $|\Psi_n\rangle_\nu$ for $n > 0$, represent the states of the system when some of the particles are in higher energy states.

The physical interpretation of the Fock space is crucial to understanding the behavior of many-body systems. It provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles, and it is used to construct the wave functions of these particles. This is particularly important in the study of quantum statistics, where the states of identical particles are classified into two types: bosons and fermions.

#### 2.3c Fock Space and Its Mathematical Properties

The Fock space, as we have seen, is a complex vector space that provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles. It is a direct sum of tensor products of copies of a single-particle Hilbert space $H$. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
F_\nu(H) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty} S_\nu H^{\otimes n}
$$

Here, $S_\nu$ is the symmetrization operator for identical particles, and $H^{\otimes n}$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $H$. The Fock space is a complex vector space, and its basis states are the states of $n$ identical particles, where $n$ can be 0, 1, 2, ...

The Fock space has several important mathematical properties that make it a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems. These properties include:

1. **Linearity**: The Fock space is a linear space, meaning that any linear combination of basis states is also a basis state. This property allows us to express any state in the Fock space as a linear combination of basis states.

2. **Completeness**: The basis states of the Fock space are complete, meaning that any state in the Fock space can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis states. This property is crucial for the Fock space to be a Hilbert space.

3. **Orthogonality**: The basis states of the Fock space are orthogonal to each other. This property is crucial for the Fock space to be a Hilbert space.

4. **Symmetry**: The Fock space is symmetric under particle exchange, reflecting the fact that the particles are identical. This property is crucial for the Fock space to be a suitable representation of the states of identical particles.

These mathematical properties of the Fock space are crucial to its physical interpretation. They allow us to construct the wave functions of identical particles, and they are particularly important in the study of quantum statistics, where the states of identical particles are classified into two types: bosons and fermions.

#### 2.3d Fock Space and Its Physical Applications

The Fock space, with its mathematical properties, has found numerous applications in the study of many-body systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the physical interpretation of the Fock space and its role in quantum statistics.

1. **Quantum Statistics**: The Fock space is used to describe the states of identical particles, such as bosons and fermions. The basis states of the Fock space represent the states of $n$ identical particles, where $n$ can be 0, 1, 2, ... This is particularly useful in quantum statistics, where the states of identical particles are classified into two types: bosons and fermions. The Fock space provides a mathematical framework for constructing the wave functions of these particles, and it is crucial for understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

2. **Second Quantization**: The Fock space is also used in the second quantization formalism, which is a powerful tool for studying many-body systems. The second quantization formalism allows us to describe the states of a many-body system in terms of creation and annihilation operators, which act on the basis states of the Fock space. This formalism is particularly useful in quantum mechanics, where it is often more convenient to describe the states of a system in terms of these operators rather than the individual particles.

3. **Quantum Field Theory**: The Fock space is used in the construction of quantum field theories, which are mathematical models used to describe the behavior of many-body systems. In quantum field theory, the Fock space is used to construct the wave functions of the fields, which are used to describe the behavior of the particles in the system. This is particularly important in particle physics, where quantum field theory is used to describe the behavior of particles at the subatomic level.

4. **Statistical Mechanics**: The Fock space is used in statistical mechanics, which is a branch of physics that deals with the statistical behavior of large assemblies of microscopic entities. In statistical mechanics, the Fock space is used to construct the wave functions of the system, which are used to calculate the statistical properties of the system. This is particularly important in the study of phase transitions, where the behavior of the system changes dramatically as a function of temperature or other parameters.

In conclusion, the Fock space, with its mathematical properties, has found numerous applications in the study of many-body systems. Its physical interpretation and its role in quantum statistics make it a crucial tool in the study of these systems.




#### 2.3b Occupation Number Representation in Fock Space

The occupation number representation is a fundamental concept in the Fock space. It provides a way to represent the states of identical particles in the Fock space. The occupation number of a state in the Fock space is defined as the number of particles in that state. 

The occupation number representation is defined as follows:

$$
\hat{n}_i = c_i^\dagger c_i
$$

where $c_i^\dagger$ and $c_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the state $i$, respectively. These operators satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations:

$$
\{c_i, c_j\} = \{c_i^\dagger, c_j^\dagger\} = 0
$$

$$
\{c_i, c_j^\dagger\} = \delta_{ij}
$$

The occupation number operator $\hat{n}_i$ has the following properties:

1. It is Hermitian: $\hat{n}_i^\dagger = \hat{n}_i$.
2. It is non-negative: $\hat{n}_i \geq 0$.
3. It has eigenvalues 0 and 1: $\hat{n}_i |n_i\rangle = n_i |n_i\rangle$, where $n_i = 0$ or 1.

The occupation number representation is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems. It allows us to represent the states of identical particles in a convenient and intuitive way. It also provides a basis for the Fock space, which is crucial for the second quantization formalism.

In the next section, we will discuss the second quantization formalism and its applications in many-body systems.

#### 2.3c Fock Space and Second Quantization

The Fock space, as we have seen, provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles. It is a direct sum of tensor products of copies of a single-particle Hilbert space $H$. The second quantization formalism, on the other hand, is a mathematical technique used to describe many-body systems. It is particularly useful in quantum statistics, where the states of identical particles are classified into two types: bosons and fermions.

The second quantization formalism is based on the concept of creation and annihilation operators. These operators are defined as follows:

$$
c_i^\dagger |n_i\rangle = \sqrt{n_i+1} |n_i+1\rangle
$$

$$
c_i |n_i\rangle = \sqrt{n_i} |n_i-1\rangle
$$

where $c_i^\dagger$ and $c_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the state $i$, respectively, and $n_i$ is the occupation number of the state $i$. These operators satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations:

$$
\{c_i, c_j\} = \{c_i^\dagger, c_j^\dagger\} = 0
$$

$$
\{c_i, c_j^\dagger\} = \delta_{ij}
$$

The second quantization formalism allows us to represent the states of many-body systems in a convenient and intuitive way. It also provides a powerful tool for calculating physical quantities, such as the energy of the system.

The Fock space and the second quantization formalism are closely related. The Fock space provides a mathematical representation of the states of identical particles, while the second quantization formalism provides a mathematical tool for describing these states. The second quantization formalism is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where the number of particles can be large.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of the Fock space and the second quantization formalism in the study of many-body systems.




#### 2.3c Fock Space Operators and Their Algebra

The Fock space is equipped with a rich algebra of operators, which are crucial for the second quantization formalism. These operators are defined on the Fock space and act on the states of identical particles. They are particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where the states of identical particles are classified into two types: bosons and fermions.

The algebra of Fock space operators is generated by the creation and annihilation operators, which are defined as follows:

$$
a_i^\dagger |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i + 1} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i + 1, \ldots\rangle
$$

$$
a_i |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle = \sqrt{n_i} |n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i - 1, \ldots\rangle
$$

where $n_i$ is the occupation number of the state $i$. These operators satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations:

$$
\{a_i, a_j\} = \{a_i^\dagger, a_j^\dagger\} = 0
$$

$$
\{a_i, a_j^\dagger\} = \delta_{ij}
$$

The creation and annihilation operators have the following properties:

1. They are Hermitian conjugates of each other: $a_i^\dagger = a_i^\dagger$.
2. They increase or decrease the occupation number by one: $a_i^\dagger a_i = n_i + 1$ and $a_i a_i^\dagger = n_i$.
3. They satisfy the following commutation relations: $[a_i, a_j^\dagger] = \delta_{ij}$ and $[a_i, a_j] = 0$.

The algebra of Fock space operators is also equipped with the number operator, which is defined as follows:

$$
\hat{n}_i = a_i^\dagger a_i
$$

The number operator has the following properties:

1. It is Hermitian: $\hat{n}_i^\dagger = \hat{n}_i$.
2. It is non-negative: $\hat{n}_i \geq 0$.
3. It has eigenvalues 0 and 1: $\hat{n}_i |n_i\rangle = n_i |n_i\rangle$, where $n_i = 0$ or 1.

The algebra of Fock space operators is crucial for the second quantization formalism. It provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles and their interactions. In the next section, we will discuss the second quantization formalism in more detail and explore its applications in many-body systems.




#### 2.3d Occupation Number Formalism in Fock Space

The occupation number formalism is a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems. It provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles in the Fock space. The occupation number of a state is defined as the number of identical particles in that state. It is represented by the number operator $\hat{n}_i$, which was introduced in the previous section.

The occupation number formalism is particularly useful in the study of bosons and fermions. For bosons, the occupation number can take any non-negative integer value, while for fermions, it can only take the values 0 or 1. This leads to different statistical behaviors for bosons and fermions, which are described by the Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi-Dirac statistics, respectively.

The occupation number formalism is also closely related to the concept of Fock space. The Fock space is a vector space that describes the states of a system of identical particles. It is spanned by the states $|n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_i, \ldots\rangle$, where $n_i$ is the occupation number of the state $i$. The creation and annihilation operators $a_i^\dagger$ and $a_i$ act on these states, increasing or decreasing the occupation number by one.

The occupation number formalism is crucial for the second quantization formalism. It provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of identical particles and their interactions. In the next section, we will discuss the second quantization formalism in more detail.




#### 2.4a Normal Ordering and Wick's Theorem

Wick's theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics that provides a method for expressing the normal-ordered product of field operators in terms of the field operators themselves. This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner.

The normal-ordered product of field operators is defined as:

$$
:A(x)B(y): = A(x)B(y) - \langle A(x)B(y) \rangle + \langle A(x) \rangle \langle B(y) \rangle
$$

where $A(x)$ and $B(y)$ are field operators, and $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denotes the expectation value. The normal-ordered product is a key concept in quantum mechanics, as it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a way that is independent of the state of the system.

Wick's theorem states that the normal-ordered product of field operators can be expressed as a sum of products of field operators, each of which is normal-ordered. Mathematically, this can be written as:

$$
:A(x)B(y): = \sum_i \langle A(x_i) \rangle \langle B(y_i) \rangle + \sum_j A(x_j)B(y_j) - \sum_k \langle A(x_k)B(y_k) \rangle
$$

where the sums are over all possible combinations of field operators. This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner.

Wick's theorem is closely related to the concept of normal ordering. Normal ordering is a mathematical operation that rearranges the terms in an expression to ensure that all creation operators are to the left of all annihilation operators. This is important because creation operators act on the vacuum state to create particles, while annihilation operators act on the vacuum state to destroy particles. By normal ordering an expression, we ensure that the creation operators always act before the annihilation operators, which is consistent with the physical interpretation of these operators.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of Wick's theorem and normal ordering in the study of many-body systems.

#### 2.4b Wick's Theorem and Cumulants

Wick's theorem is not only useful for expressing the normal-ordered product of field operators, but it also has applications in the study of cumulants. Cumulants are a set of numbers that describe the statistical properties of a random variable. They are particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where they allow us to express the interactions between particles in a way that is independent of the state of the system.

The cumulant generating function $K(\lambda)$ of a random variable $X$ is defined as:

$$
K(\lambda) = \ln \mathbb{E} \left[ e^{\lambda X} \right]
$$

where $\mathbb{E}$ denotes the expectation value. The cumulants $\kappa_n$ of $X$ are then defined as the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of $K(\lambda)$:

$$
K(\lambda) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^n}{n!} \kappa_n
$$

Wick's theorem can be used to express the cumulants of a random variable in terms of the field operators. This is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where the cumulants can provide valuable insights into the statistical properties of the system.

The cumulant generating function $K(\lambda)$ can be expressed in terms of the field operators $A(x)$ and $B(y)$ as:

$$
K(\lambda) = \ln \mathbb{E} \left[ e^{\lambda \left( A(x) + B(y) \right)} \right]
$$

Using Wick's theorem, we can express the cumulants $\kappa_n$ of $X$ as:

$$
\kappa_n = \sum_i \langle A(x_i) \rangle \langle B(y_i) \rangle + \sum_j A(x_j)B(y_j) - \sum_k \langle A(x_k)B(y_k) \rangle
$$

where the sums are over all possible combinations of field operators. This expression allows us to calculate the cumulants of a random variable in terms of the field operators, providing a powerful tool for studying the statistical properties of many-body systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of Wick's theorem and cumulants in the study of many-body systems.

#### 2.4c Wick's Theorem and Cumulants (Continued)

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of cumulants and how they can be expressed in terms of field operators using Wick's theorem. In this section, we will delve deeper into the application of Wick's theorem and cumulants in the study of many-body systems.

The cumulant generating function $K(\lambda)$ is a powerful tool for studying the statistical properties of a random variable. It allows us to express the cumulants $\kappa_n$ of a random variable in terms of the field operators $A(x)$ and $B(y)$. This is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where the cumulants can provide valuable insights into the statistical properties of the system.

The cumulant generating function $K(\lambda)$ can be expressed in terms of the field operators $A(x)$ and $B(y)$ as:

$$
K(\lambda) = \ln \mathbb{E} \left[ e^{\lambda \left( A(x) + B(y) \right)} \right]
$$

Using Wick's theorem, we can express the cumulants $\kappa_n$ of $X$ as:

$$
\kappa_n = \sum_i \langle A(x_i) \rangle \langle B(y_i) \rangle + \sum_j A(x_j)B(y_j) - \sum_k \langle A(x_k)B(y_k) \rangle
$$

where the sums are over all possible combinations of field operators. This expression allows us to calculate the cumulants of a random variable in terms of the field operators, providing a powerful tool for studying the statistical properties of many-body systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of Wick's theorem and cumulants in the study of many-body systems.

#### 2.4d Wick's Theorem and Cumulants (Conclusion)

$$
\kappa_n = \sum_i \langle A(x_i) \rangle \langle B(y_i) \rangle + \sum_j A(x_j)B(y_j) - \sum_k \langle A(x_k)B(y_k) \rangle
$$

where the sums are over all possible combinations of field operators. This expression allows us to calculate the cumulants of a random variable in terms of the field operators, providing a powerful tool for studying the statistical properties of many-body systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of Wick's theorem and cumulants in the study of many-body systems.

The many-body problem is a fundamental concept in quantum physics, particularly in the field of condensed matter physics and quantum statistics. It refers to the study of systems composed of a large number of interacting particles, such as atoms in a gas or electrons in a solid. The complexity of these systems often necessitates the use of approximation methods, such as the mean-field theory, to make them tractable.

#### 2.4b Wick's Theorem for Fermionic Operators

Wick's theorem is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to express the normal-ordered product of field operators in terms of the field operators themselves. This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner.

In the previous section, we discussed Wick's theorem for bosonic creation and annihilation operators. Now, we will extend this theorem to fermionic operators. Fermionic operators are operators that act on fermionic states, which are states with half-integer spin. Examples of fermionic operators include the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, which create and destroy fermions, respectively.

The proof of Wick's theorem for fermionic operators is similar to the proof for bosonic operators. We use induction to prove the theorem for $N$ fermionic operators $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$, where $N$ is a positive integer. The base case is trivial, because there is only one possible contraction:

$$
\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots = \hat{B} \mathopen{:}\hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots \mathclose{:}
$$

In general, the only non-zero contractions are between an annihilation operator on the left and a creation operator on the right. Suppose that Wick's theorem is true for $N-1$ operators $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$, and consider the effect of adding an "N"th operator $\hat{A}$ to the left of $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$ to form $\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}\hat{D}\hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$. By Wick's theorem applied to $N-1$ operators, we have:

$$
\hat{A} \hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots = \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^\bullet \hat{C}^\bullet \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F} \ldots \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^\bullet \hat{C}^{\bullet\bullet} \hat{D}^{\bullet\bullet} \hat{E}^\bullet \hat{F} \ldots \mathclose{:} + \ldots
$$

where $\hat{A}$ is either a creation operator or an annihilation operator. If $\hat{A}$ is a creation operator, all above products, such as $\hat{A}\mathopen{:}\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots \mathclose{:}$, are already normal ordered and require no further manipulation. Because $\hat{A}$ is to the left of all annihilation operators in $\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}\hat{D}\hat{E}\hat{F}\ldots$, any contraction involving it will be zero. Thus, we can add all contractions involving $\hat{A}$ to the sums without changing their value. Therefore, if $\hat{A}$ is a creation operator, Wick's theorem holds for $\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}\hat{D}\hat{E}\hat{F}\ldots$.

Now, suppose that $\hat{A}$ is an annihilation operator. In this case, the only non-zero contractions are between $\hat{A}$ and the creation operators $\hat{B}^\bullet$, $\hat{C}^\bullet$, and $\hat{D}^\bullet$. These contractions can be written as $\hat{A} \hat{B}^\bullet$, $\hat{A} \hat{C}^\bullet$, and $\hat{A} \hat{D}^\bullet$, respectively. By Wick's theorem applied to $N-1$ operators, we have:

$$
\hat{A} \hat{B}^\bullet = \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{B}^\bullet \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^{\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^{\bullet\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \ldots
$$

$$
\hat{A} \hat{C}^\bullet = \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{C}^\bullet \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{C}^{\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{C}^{\bullet\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \ldots
$$

$$
\hat{A} \hat{D}^\bullet = \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{D}^\bullet \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{D}^{\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{D}^{\bullet\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \ldots
$$

By adding these equations, we obtain:

$$
\hat{A} \hat{B}^\bullet + \hat{A} \hat{C}^\bullet + \hat{A} \hat{D}^\bullet = \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{B}^\bullet + \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{C}^\bullet + \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{D}^\bullet \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^{\bullet\bullet} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{C}^{\bullet\bullet} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{D}^{\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^{\bullet\bullet\bullet} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{C}^{\bullet\bullet\bullet} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{D}^{\bullet\bullet\bullet} \mathclose{:} + \ldots
$$

This equation holds for any choice of $\hat{A}$, $\hat{B}$, $\hat{C}$, and $\hat{D}$. Therefore, Wick's theorem holds for $\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}\hat{D}\hat{E}\hat{F}\ldots$.

In conclusion, Wick's theorem is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to express the normal-ordered product of field operators in terms of the field operators themselves. This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner.




#### 2.4c Wick's Theorem for Bosonic Operators

Wick's theorem is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to express the normal-ordered product of field operators in terms of the field operators themselves. This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner.

In the previous section, we discussed Wick's theorem for fermionic operators. Now, we will extend this theorem to bosonic operators. Bosonic operators are operators that act on bosonic states, which are states with integer spin. Examples of bosonic operators include the bosonic creation and annihilation operators, which create and destroy bosons, respectively.

The proof of Wick's theorem for bosonic operators is similar to the proof for fermionic operators. We use induction to prove the theorem for $N$ bosonic operators $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$, where $N$ is a positive integer. The base case is trivial, because there is only one possible contraction:

$$
\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots = \hat{B} \mathopen{:}\hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots \mathclose{:}
$$

In general, the only non-zero contractions are between an annihilation operator on the left and a creation operator on the right. Suppose that Wick's theorem is true for $N-1$ operators $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$, and consider the effect of adding an "N"th operator $\hat{A}$ to the left of $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$ to form $\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}\hat{D}\hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$. By Wick's theorem applied to $N-1$ operators, we have:

$$
\hat{A} \hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots = \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^\bullet \hat{C}^\bullet \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F} \ldots \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^\bullet \hat{C}^{\bullet\bullet} \hat{D}^{\bullet\bullet} \hat{E}^\bullet \hat{F} \ldots \mathclose{:} + \ldots
$$

where the dots indicate terms with more than two contractions. The proof then proceeds by showing that each term in the sum is equal to the normal-ordered product of the operators. This is done by considering the possible contractions between the operators and using the commutation relations between them. The proof is similar to the one for fermionic operators, but with some modifications to account for the different commutation relations between bosonic operators.

In conclusion, Wick's theorem is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to express the normal-ordered product of field operators in terms of the field operators themselves. This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner. In the next section, we will discuss the application of Wick's theorem to the study of many-body systems.





#### 2.4d Wick's Theorem for Mixed Operators

Wick's theorem is a powerful tool that allows us to express the normal-ordered product of field operators in terms of the field operators themselves. This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, where it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner.

In the previous sections, we have discussed Wick's theorem for fermionic and bosonic operators. Now, we will extend this theorem to mixed operators, which are operators that act on both fermionic and bosonic states. Mixed operators are particularly important in quantum mechanics, as they allow us to describe systems that contain both fermions and bosons.

The proof of Wick's theorem for mixed operators is similar to the proof for fermionic and bosonic operators. We use induction to prove the theorem for $N$ mixed operators $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$, where $N$ is a positive integer. The base case is trivial, because there is only one possible contraction:

$$
\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots = \hat{B} \mathopen{:}\hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots \mathclose{:}
$$

In general, the only non-zero contractions are between an annihilation operator on the left and a creation operator on the right. Suppose that Wick's theorem is true for $N-1$ operators $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$, and consider the effect of adding an "N"th operator $\hat{A}$ to the left of $\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$ to form $\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}\hat{D}\hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots$. By Wick's theorem applied to $N-1$ operators, we have:

$$
\hat{A} \hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots = \hat{A} \mathopen{:}\hat{B} \hat{C} \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F}\ldots \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{singles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^\bullet \hat{C}^\bullet \hat{D} \hat{E} \hat{F} \ldots \mathclose{:} + \hat{A} \sum_\text{doubles} \mathopen{:} \hat{B}^\bullet \hat{C}^{\bullet\bullet} \hat{D}^{\bullet\bullet} \hat{E}^\bullet \hat{F} \ldots \mathclose{:} + \ldots
$$

where the dots represent the sum over all possible contractions involving $\hat{A}$. The proof then proceeds as before, by showing that the only non-zero contractions are between an annihilation operator on the left and a creation operator on the right. This completes the proof of Wick's theorem for mixed operators.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of Wick's theorem to specific examples, to further illustrate its power and utility in quantum mechanics.




#### 2.5a Normal Ordering in Second Quantization

In the previous sections, we have discussed the normal ordering of operators in the context of many-body systems. Now, we will extend this discussion to the second quantization formalism, which is a powerful mathematical tool for describing systems of identical particles.

In second quantization, the creation and annihilation operators for identical particles are introduced. These operators are defined as:

$$
\hat{a}^\dagger_i = \sqrt{n_i + 1} \hat{c}^\dagger_i
$$

$$
\hat{a}_i = \sqrt{n_i} \hat{c}_i
$$

where $n_i = \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}_i$ is the number operator for the $i$th particle, and $\hat{c}^\dagger_i$ and $\hat{c}_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the $i$th particle in the single-particle basis.

The normal ordering of operators in second quantization is defined as the ordering where all the annihilation operators are to the left of all the creation operators. This is similar to the normal ordering in the first quantization formalism, but with the added complexity of the number operators.

The normal ordering of operators in second quantization is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, as it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner. For example, the normal ordering of the interaction term in the Hamiltonian can be written as:

$$
\hat{H}_{int} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} V_{ij} \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}_j \hat{a}_i
$$

where $V_{ij}$ is the interaction potential between the $i$th and $j$th particles. This expression is particularly useful in the study of systems with long-range interactions, where the interaction potential depends on the distance between the particles.

In the next section, we will discuss the normal ordering of operators in the context of the Hubbard model, a fundamental model in the study of many-body systems.

#### 2.5b Normal Ordering and Wick's Theorem

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of normal ordering in second quantization. Now, we will explore the relationship between normal ordering and Wick's theorem, a fundamental result in quantum statistics.

Wick's theorem is a result that expresses the normal-ordered product of field operators in terms of the field operators themselves. In the context of second quantization, this theorem can be stated as follows:

$$
\mathopen{:}\hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_l \mathclose{:} = \hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_l + \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} \hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j
$$

This theorem is particularly useful in the study of many-body systems, as it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner. For example, the interaction term in the Hamiltonian can be written as:

$$
\hat{H}_{int} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} V_{ij} \mathopen{:}\hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i \mathclose{:}
$$

where $V_{ij}$ is the interaction potential between the $i$th and $j$th particles. This expression is particularly useful in the study of systems with long-range interactions, where the interaction potential depends on the distance between the particles.

The proof of Wick's theorem involves the use of the commutation relations between the creation and annihilation operators. These commutation relations are given by:

$$
[\hat{a}_i, \hat{a}^\dagger_j] = \delta_{ij}
$$

$$
[\hat{a}_i, \hat{a}_j] = [\hat{a}^\dagger_i, \hat{a}^\dagger_j] = 0
$$

Using these commutation relations, we can show that the normal-ordered product of field operators satisfies the following identity:

$$
\mathopen{:}\hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_l \mathclose{:} = \hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_l + \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} \hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j
$$

This identity is the statement of Wick's theorem. It shows that the normal-ordered product of field operators can be expressed in terms of the field operators themselves, plus a term that accounts for the contraction of the field operators. This result is fundamental to the study of many-body systems, as it allows us to express the interactions between particles in a simple and elegant manner.

#### 2.5c Normal Ordering and Wick's Theorem

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of normal ordering and Wick's theorem. Now, we will delve deeper into the relationship between these two concepts and their applications in many-body systems.

$$

where $V_{ij}$ is the interaction potential between the $i$th and $j$th particles. This expression is particularly useful in the study of systems with long-range interactions, where the interaction potential depends on the distance between the particles.

The proof of Wick's theorem involves the use of the commutation relations between the creation and annihilation operators. These commutation relations are given by:

$$
[\hat{a}_i, \hat{a}^\dagger_j] = \delta_{ij}
$$

$$
[\hat{a}_i, \hat{a}_j] = [\hat{a}^\dagger_i, \hat{a}^\dagger_j] = 0
$$

Using these commutation relations, we can show that the normal-ordered product of field operators satisfies the following identity:

$$
\mathopen{:}\hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_l \mathclose{:} = \hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_l + \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} \hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j
$$

## Chapter: Many-Body Problem

### Introduction

The many-body problem is a fundamental concept in the field of condensed matter physics, quantum mechanics, and quantum statistics. It is a problem that involves the study of a system of interacting particles, where the number of particles is large enough that the system exhibits collective behavior. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of the many-body problem, providing a comprehensive understanding of its principles and applications.

The many-body problem is a cornerstone of quantum statistics, particularly in the study of systems of identical particles. It is a problem that is inherently statistical in nature, and it is one of the key areas where quantum statistics differs from classical statistics. The many-body problem is also a critical concept in condensed matter physics, where it is used to describe the behavior of electrons in a solid.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical formalism of the many-body problem, including the concepts of second quantization and the Hubbard model. We will also discuss the mean-field theory, a powerful tool for approximating the solutions of the many-body problem. The mean-field theory is a method that simplifies the many-body problem by approximating the interactions between particles with a mean field. This approximation is particularly useful in systems where the interactions between particles are long-range, such as in systems of interacting electrons in a solid.

The many-body problem is a complex and fascinating area of study, with applications ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum statistics. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the many-body problem, equipping readers with the necessary tools to understand and tackle this important problem.




#### 2.5b Normal Ordering and Vacuum Expectation Values

In the previous section, we discussed the normal ordering of operators in second quantization and its importance in the study of many-body systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of normal ordering and its relationship with the vacuum expectation values.

The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of an operator $\hat{O}$ is defined as the expectation value of $\hat{O}$ in the vacuum state $|0\rangle$:

$$
\langle 0 | \hat{O} | 0 \rangle
$$

In the context of many-body systems, the vacuum state $|0\rangle$ represents the ground state of the system, where all the particles are in their lowest energy levels.

The VEV of a normal ordered operator is particularly interesting because it provides information about the ground state of the system. For example, the VEV of the Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ in the vacuum state is equal to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the system:

$$
\langle 0 | \hat{H} | 0 \rangle = E_0
$$

This is because the Hamiltonian is a normal ordered operator, and its VEV in the vacuum state is equal to its expectation value in any other state.

The VEV of a normal ordered operator can also be used to calculate the VEV of a non-normal ordered operator. This is done using Wick's theorem, which states that the VEV of a non-normal ordered product of operators can be expressed as a sum of VEVs of normal ordered products. For example, the VEV of a product of three operators $\hat{O}_1$, $\hat{O}_2$, and $\hat{O}_3$ can be calculated as:

$$
\langle 0 | \hat{O}_1 \hat{O}_2 \hat{O}_3 | 0 \rangle = \langle 0 | :\hat{O}_1 \hat{O}_2 \hat{O}_3: | 0 \rangle + \langle 0 | :\hat{O}_1 \hat{O}_2: \langle 0 | \hat{O}_3 | 0 \rangle + \langle 0 | :\hat{O}_1 \hat{O}_3: \langle 0 | \hat{O}_2 | 0 \rangle + \langle 0 | :\hat{O}_2 \hat{O}_3: \langle 0 | \hat{O}_1 | 0 \rangle + \langle 0 | :\hat{O}_3 \hat{O}_1: \langle 0 | \hat{O}_2 | 0 \rangle + \langle 0 | :\hat{O}_3 \hat{O}_2: \langle 0 | \hat{O}_1 | 0 \rangle
$$

This result can be generalized to any number of operators.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of normal ordering and Wick's theorem in the context of the Hubbard model, a fundamental model in the study of many-body systems.




#### 2.5c Normal Ordering and Wick's Theorem

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of normal ordering and its importance in the study of many-body systems. We also introduced the concept of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and how they can be used to calculate the VEV of a non-normal ordered operator. In this section, we will delve deeper into the relationship between normal ordering and Wick's theorem.

Wick's theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics that provides a method for calculating the VEV of a non-normal ordered product of operators. It states that the VEV of a non-normal ordered product of operators can be expressed as a sum of VEVs of normal ordered products. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
\langle 0 | \hat{O}_1 \hat{O}_2 \cdots \hat{O}_n | 0 \rangle = \sum_{\text{all normal orderings}} \langle 0 | :\hat{O}_{i_1} \hat{O}_{i_2} \cdots \hat{O}_{i_n}: | 0 \rangle
$$

where $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n$ are the indices of the operators in the normal ordering, and the sum is over all possible normal orderings of the operators.

The proof of Wick's theorem involves the use of the Cauchy-Binet formula, which provides a method for calculating the determinant of a block matrix. In the context of many-body systems, the block matrix represents the matrix elements of the operators $\hat{O}_1, \hat{O}_2, \ldots, \hat{O}_n$ in the Fock space.

The Cauchy-Binet formula can be written as:

$$
\det \mathbf{M} = \sum_{\text{all partitions}} \det \mathbf{M}_1 \det \mathbf{M}_2 \cdots \det \mathbf{M}_k
$$

where $\mathbf{M}$ is the block matrix, $\mathbf{M}_1, \mathbf{M}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{M}_k$ are the submatrices corresponding to the partition, and the sum is over all possible partitions of the matrix.

In the context of many-body systems, the submatrices $\mathbf{M}_1, \mathbf{M}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{M}_k$ represent the matrix elements of the operators $\hat{O}_1, \hat{O}_2, \ldots, \hat{O}_n$ in the Fock space. Therefore, the Cauchy-Binet formula can be used to calculate the VEV of a non-normal ordered product of operators, which is given by the determinant of the block matrix.

In conclusion, Wick's theorem provides a powerful tool for calculating the VEV of a non-normal ordered product of operators in many-body systems. It is based on the concept of normal ordering and the Cauchy-Binet formula, and it is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics.




#### 2.5d Applications of Normal Ordering in Many-Body Theory

Normal ordering plays a crucial role in many-body theory, particularly in the study of condensed matter systems. It is used to simplify the calculation of physical quantities, such as the ground state energy and correlation functions, by rearranging the operators in a way that the normal ordered operators have lower commutation relations. This allows us to express the physical quantities in terms of the vacuum expectation values of the normal ordered operators, which can be calculated using Wick's theorem.

One of the most important applications of normal ordering in many-body theory is in the calculation of the ground state energy. The ground state energy is a fundamental quantity that provides information about the stability and properties of the system. It can be calculated using the variational principle, which states that the ground state energy is the lowest possible energy that can be achieved by the system.

The variational principle can be expressed as:

$$
E_0 = \min_{\Psi} \langle \Psi | \hat{H} | \Psi \rangle
$$

where $\Psi$ is a trial wave function, and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator. The trial wave function is a function of the field operators $\hat{\psi}$ and $\hat{\psi}^\dagger$, and it can be written as:

$$
\Psi = \Psi[\hat{\psi}, \hat{\psi}^\dagger]
$$

By using normal ordering, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian operator as:

$$
\hat{H} = \int d^3x \left[ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla \hat{\psi}^\dagger \nabla \hat{\psi} + \frac{1}{2} \hat{\psi}^\dagger \hat{\psi}^\dagger \hat{\psi} \hat{\psi} + V(\hat{\psi}^\dagger \hat{\psi}) \right]
$$

where $V(\hat{\psi}^\dagger \hat{\psi})$ is the potential energy term. The normal ordering of the Hamiltonian operator allows us to express the ground state energy as:

$$
E_0 = \min_{\Psi} \langle \Psi | \hat{H} | \Psi \rangle = \min_{\Psi} \int d^3x \left[ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla \Psi^\dagger \nabla \Psi + \frac{1}{2} \Psi^\dagger \Psi^\dagger \Psi \Psi + V(\Psi^\dagger \Psi) \right]
$$

This form of the ground state energy allows us to calculate it using the variational principle, by minimizing the energy functional with respect to the trial wave function. This is a powerful tool in many-body theory, as it allows us to systematically improve our understanding of the system by using more sophisticated trial wave functions.

In addition to the ground state energy, normal ordering is also used in the calculation of correlation functions, which provide information about the statistical properties of the system. The correlation functions can be expressed in terms of the vacuum expectation values of the normal ordered operators, which can be calculated using Wick's theorem.

In conclusion, normal ordering plays a crucial role in many-body theory, providing a powerful tool for the calculation of physical quantities. Its applications range from the calculation of the ground state energy to the study of correlation functions, and it is a fundamental concept in the study of condensed matter systems.

In addition, we have discussed the concept of Fock space, a mathematical space that describes the states of a many-body system. The Fock space is a crucial concept in second quantization, as it provides a mathematical framework for describing the states of a many-body system. We have seen how the Fock space is constructed, and how it is used to describe the states of a many-body system.

In conclusion, second quantization is a powerful mathematical tool that allows us to describe many-body systems in a more efficient and elegant manner.

This theory, which is a cornerstone of many-body physics, provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of systems with a large number of interacting particles.

Mean Field Theory is a simplification of the many-body problem, where the particles are assumed to be influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles. This allows us to solve the equations of motion analytically, making it a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Mean Field Theory, including the mean field potential and the mean field equations. We will also discuss the applications of Mean Field Theory in various fields, such as condensed matter physics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics.

## Chapter 3: Many-Body Perturbation Theory

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have discussed the basics of condensed matter systems and the concept of many-body systems. We have also explored the Hartree-Fock theory, which is a mean-field theory that provides a simplified description of many-body systems. However, in many cases, the Hartree-Fock theory is not sufficient to fully capture the behavior of many-body systems. This is where many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) comes into play.

MBPT is a powerful tool that allows us to systematically incorporate the correlations between particles in a many-body system. It is based on the perturbative expansion of the many-body Hamiltonian, which is the Hamiltonian that describes the interactions between all the particles in the system. By expanding the Hamiltonian in terms of a small parameter, we can systematically include the effects of correlations on the properties of the system.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the concept of MBPT and its applications in condensed matter systems. We will start by discussing the basics of MBPT, including the perturbative expansion of the Hamiltonian and the concept of perturbation order. We will then explore the different perturbation orders and their corresponding terms, such as the mean-field term, the correlation term, and the vertex term. We will also discuss the mathematical techniques used in MBPT, such as the Dyson equation and the Feynman diagrams.

Furthermore, we will also cover the applications of MBPT in condensed matter systems, such as the study of electronic band structure, metal-insulator transitions, and phase transitions. We will also discuss the limitations and challenges of MBPT, such as the breakdown of perturbation theory and the need for non-perturbative methods.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to many-body perturbation theory and its applications in condensed matter systems. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques of MBPT and its role in the study of many-body systems.

## Chapter 3: Many-Body Perturbation Theory




### Subsection: 3.1a Dyson Series and Its Convergence

The Dyson series is a fundamental concept in many-body perturbation theory. It is a perturbative expansion of the Green's function, which is a fundamental quantity in condensed matter physics. The Green's function describes the propagation of a particle in a many-body system and is defined as the inverse of the single-particle Hamiltonian.

The Dyson series is given by the following equation:

$$
G = G_0 + G_0\Sigma G + G_0\Sigma G\Sigma G + \ldots
$$

where $G$ is the Green's function, $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function, and $\Sigma$ is the self-energy. The self-energy accounts for the correlations between particles in the system and is the main focus of many-body perturbation theory.

The Dyson series is an infinite series, and its convergence is a crucial aspect of many-body perturbation theory. The series is expected to converge when the self-energy is small compared to the non-interacting Green's function. However, in many cases, the self-energy is not small, and the series may not converge. In such cases, the Dyson series can be used to obtain an approximate solution for the Green's function.

The Dyson series can also be written in a more compact form using the Dyson equation:

$$
G = G_0 + G_0\Sigma G = G_0 + G_0\Sigma_0 G_0 + G_0\Sigma_0 G_0\Sigma_0 G_0 + \ldots
$$

where $\Sigma_0$ is the non-interacting self-energy. This form of the Dyson series is useful for understanding the structure of the series and its convergence.

The Dyson series is a powerful tool in many-body perturbation theory, but it is important to note that it is only an approximation. The series may not converge in all cases, and the resulting Green's function may not accurately describe the behavior of the system. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the convergence of the Dyson series and its limitations when using it in condensed matter systems.








### Section: 3.1 Diagrammatic Expansion of Dyson Series

The Dyson series is a perturbative solution to the many-body problem, which allows us to calculate the properties of a system by iteratively applying the perturbation to the non-interacting system. In the previous section, we discussed the Dyson series and its application in the context of the CH<sub>2</sub> molecule. In this section, we will delve deeper into the diagrammatic expansion of the Dyson series, which provides a graphical representation of the perturbative calculations.

#### 3.1c Diagrammatic Expansion of Dyson Series

The Dyson series can be represented diagrammatically using the product operator formalism. This formalism allows us to represent the evolution of the system as a series of operators acting on the system's state. The operators represent the physical observables of the system, such as the spin of a particle.

Consider the CH<sub>2</sub> molecule discussed in the previous section. The evolution of the system can be represented as a series of operators acting on the system's state. For example, the evolution from the initial state (0) to the second excited state (2) can be represented as:

$$
(0) \to (2): \quad L_z + L_z' \xrightarrow{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)_{xL}} -L_y + L_z' \xrightarrow{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)_{xL'}} -L_y - L_y' \xrightarrow{J-\text{coup.}} 2 L_x S_z + 2 L_x' S_z
$$

This representation allows us to easily visualize the evolution of the system and the effects of the perturbation. The operators representing the physical observables are denoted by the corresponding capital letters, while the evolution operators are denoted by the corresponding lowercase letters.

The diagrammatic expansion of the Dyson series provides a systematic way to calculate the properties of the system. The expansion is based on the Feynman diagrams, which represent the possible ways the perturbation can act on the system. Each Feynman diagram corresponds to a term in the Dyson series, and the sum of all the terms gives the total perturbative correction.

The Feynman diagrams for the CH<sub>2</sub> molecule are shown below:

$$
\begin{align*}
(0) &\to (1): \quad L_z + L_z' \xrightarrow{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)_{xL}} -L_y + L_z' \xrightarrow{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)_{xL'}} -L_y - L_y' \\
(1) &\to (2): \quad -L_y - L_y' \xrightarrow{J-\text{coup.}} 2 L_x S_z + 2 L_x' S_z \\
(2) &\to (3): \quad 2 L_x S_z + 2 L_x' S_z \xrightarrow{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)_{xS}} -2 L_x S_y - 2 L_x' S_y \xrightarrow{\left(\pi\right)_{xL}} -2 L_x S_y - 2 L_x' S_y \xrightarrow{\left(\pi\right)_{xL'}} -2 L_x S_y - 2 L_x' S_y \\
(3) &\to (4): \quad -2 L_x S_y - 2 L_x' S_y \xrightarrow{J-\text{coup.}} 4 L_x L_z' S_x + 4 L_z L_x' S_x \\
(4) &\to (5): \quad 4 L_x L_z' S_x + 4 L_z L_x' S_x \xrightarrow{\left(\pi\right)_{xS}} 4 L_x L_z' S_x + 4 L_z L_x' S_x \xrightarrow{(\theta)_{yL}} -8 L_zL_z' S_x \cos\theta\sin\theta + \text{others} \xrightarrow{(\theta)_{yL'}} -8 L_zL_z' S_x \cos\theta\sin\theta + \text{others}
\end{align*}
$$

Each term in the series corresponds to a Feynman diagram, and the sum of all the terms gives the total perturbative correction. The diagrammatic expansion of the Dyson series provides a powerful tool for calculating the properties of many-body systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the cyclic commutators, which are essential for dealing with the evolution of the system under the perturbation.

## Chapter 4: Many-Body Green's Functions

### Introduction

In the realm of condensed matter physics, the concept of many-body systems is fundamental. These systems are composed of a large number of interacting particles, and their behavior cannot be fully understood by studying the individual particles. Instead, we need to consider the collective behavior of the system, which is governed by the many-body Green's functions.

The Green's function, named after the British mathematician George Green, is a mathematical function that describes the propagation of a disturbance in a medium. In the context of many-body systems, the Green's function describes the propagation of a disturbance (such as an excitation) through the system. It is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems, as it encapsulates all the information about the system's response to a disturbance.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of many-body Green's functions. We will start by introducing the concept of Green's functions and their role in many-body systems. We will then explore the mathematical formalism of Green's functions, including their properties and how they are calculated. We will also discuss the physical interpretation of Green's functions, and how they can be used to understand the behavior of many-body systems.

We will also introduce the concept of the Dyson equation, a fundamental equation in the theory of many-body systems. The Dyson equation relates the Green's function of a system to its self-energy, which describes the effect of the system's interactions on the propagation of a disturbance. The Dyson equation is a cornerstone of many-body theory, and it will be a key topic of discussion in this chapter.

Finally, we will discuss some applications of many-body Green's functions in condensed matter physics. These include the study of electronic band structures, the calculation of transport properties, and the understanding of phase transitions. We will also touch upon some recent developments in the field, such as the use of machine learning techniques to calculate Green's functions.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of many-body Green's functions and their role in the study of condensed matter systems. You will be equipped with the mathematical tools and physical insights needed to explore this fascinating field further.

#### 3.2b Perturbation Theory in Interaction Picture

In the previous section, we introduced the Feynman rules and diagrammatic notation, which provide a powerful tool for calculating the probability amplitudes for particle interactions. In this section, we will delve deeper into the perturbation theory in the interaction picture, which is a key concept in many-body perturbation theory.

The interaction picture is a convenient frame of reference for studying the dynamics of a quantum system. In this picture, the system is assumed to be initially in a state that is an eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, and the perturbation is turned on at time $t=0$. The state of the system at any time $t$ is then given by the interaction picture state $|\psi_I(t)\rangle$, which evolves according to the Schrödinger equation:

$$
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}|\psi_I(t)\rangle = H_I(t)|\psi_I(t)\rangle
$$

where $H_I(t)$ is the interaction Hamiltonian.

The interaction picture state $|\psi_I(t)\rangle$ can be expressed in terms of the unperturbed state $|\psi_0\rangle$ and the interaction picture operator $U_I(t)$, as follows:

$$
|\psi_I(t)\rangle = U_I(t)|\psi_0\rangle
$$

The interaction picture operator $U_I(t)$ satisfies the following differential equation:

$$
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}U_I(t) = H_I(t)U_I(t)
$$

The interaction picture operator $U_I(t)$ plays a crucial role in perturbation theory, as it allows us to express the perturbation theory expansion in terms of the interaction picture states and operators. The perturbation theory expansion in the interaction picture is given by the Dyson series:

$$
U_I(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-i/\hbar)^n\int_{-\infty}^{t}dt_1\int_{-\infty}^{t_1}dt_2\ldots\int_{-\infty}^{t_{n-1}}dt_nH_I(t_1)H_I(t_2)\ldots H_I(t_n)
$$

The Dyson series provides a systematic way to calculate the interaction picture operator $U_I(t)$, and hence the state of the system at any time $t$. This is a key result of perturbation theory in the interaction picture.

In the next section, we will discuss how to apply these concepts to calculate the probability amplitudes for particle interactions, using Feynman diagrams and the Feynman rules.

#### 3.2c Feynman Diagrams and Perturbation Theory

In the previous sections, we have introduced the concept of perturbation theory in the interaction picture and the Dyson series. Now, we will explore how Feynman diagrams can be used to visualize and calculate the perturbation theory expansion.

Feynman diagrams are a powerful tool in quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of perturbation theory. They provide a visual representation of the interactions between particles, allowing us to calculate the probability amplitudes for these interactions.

The basic building block of a Feynman diagram is the vertex, which represents an interaction between particles. The lines connecting the vertices represent the propagation of particles. The direction of these lines is important, as it represents the direction of time.

In perturbation theory, we are interested in calculating the probability amplitude for a particular interaction. This is represented by a Feynman diagram where the vertices represent the interactions, and the lines represent the propagation of particles between these interactions.

The Feynman rules provide a set of rules for drawing and interpreting Feynman diagrams. These rules are based on the principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity, and they allow us to calculate the probability amplitudes for particle interactions.

The Feynman rules can be summarized as follows:

1. For each vertex, assign a factor of $i\hbar$ times the interaction strength.
2. For each loop, assign a factor of $-i\hbar$.

#### 3.2c Diagrammatic Techniques for Many-Body Systems

In the previous sections, we have introduced the Feynman rules and diagrammatic notation, and the perturbation theory in the interaction picture. These concepts are fundamental to understanding the behavior of many-body systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the diagrammatic techniques that are used to calculate the probability amplitudes for particle interactions in many-body systems.

The Feynman diagrams provide a powerful tool for visualizing and calculating the probability amplitudes for particle interactions. Each diagram represents a possible outcome of a particle interaction, and the probability amplitude for this outcome is calculated by summing over all possible diagrams.

The Feynman rules provide a set of rules for constructing and calculating the probability amplitudes for particle interactions. These rules are based on the principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity. The Feynman rules are as follows:

1. For each line, draw an arrow pointing in the direction of time.

#### 3.2d Applications of Feynman Diagrams in Condensed Matter Physics

Feynman diagrams have been instrumental in the development of many-body theory in condensed matter physics. They provide a powerful tool for visualizing and calculating the probability amplitudes for particle interactions in many-body systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of Feynman diagrams in condensed matter physics.

##### Many-Body Perturbation Theory

Many-body perturbation theory is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of many-body systems. It allows us to calculate the effects of interactions between particles in a system, and to understand how these interactions affect the properties of the system. Feynman diagrams are used extensively in many-body perturbation theory to visualize and calculate the probability amplitudes for particle interactions.

For example, consider a system of interacting particles. The interaction between particles can be represented by a Feynman diagram, where the particles are represented by lines and the interaction between them is represented by a vertex. The probability amplitude for this interaction can be calculated using the Feynman rules, which provide a set of rules for constructing and calculating the probability amplitudes for particle interactions.

##### Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, Feynman diagrams are used to study the behavior of many-body systems, such as metals and insulators. They are used to calculate the properties of these systems, such as their electronic structure, magnetic properties, and thermal properties.

For example, in a metal, the electronic structure can be represented by a Feynman diagram, where the electrons are represented by lines and the interactions between them are represented by vertices. The probability amplitude for these interactions can be calculated using the Feynman rules, and this can provide insights into the electronic properties of the metal, such as its conductivity and band structure.

##### Quantum Computing

Feynman diagrams have also found applications in the field of quantum computing. In quantum computing, the behavior of quantum systems is studied using many-body theory. Feynman diagrams are used to visualize and calculate the probability amplitudes for particle interactions in these systems, and to understand how these interactions affect the behavior of the system.

For example, in a quantum computer, the behavior of quantum bits (qubits) can be represented by a Feynman diagram, where the qubits are represented by lines and the interactions between them are represented by vertices. The probability amplitude for these interactions can be calculated using the Feynman rules, and this can provide insights into the behavior of the quantum computer, such as its quantum gates and quantum algorithms.

In conclusion, Feynman diagrams have been instrumental in the development of many-body theory in condensed matter physics. They provide a powerful tool for visualizing and calculating the probability amplitudes for particle interactions in many-body systems, and have found applications in a wide range of fields, from many-body perturbation theory to condensed matter physics and quantum computing.




### Subsection: 3.3a Self-Energy and Its Physical Interpretation

The self-energy is a fundamental concept in many-body theory, providing a way to account for the effects of interactions between particles in a system. It is a complex quantity, representing both the energy and the width of a particle. In this section, we will explore the physical interpretation of the self-energy and its role in many-body theory.

#### 3.3a Self-Energy and Its Physical Interpretation

The self-energy, denoted by $\Sigma$, is a complex quantity that represents the energy and width of a particle in a many-body system. It is defined as the sum of all the one-particle irreducible (1PI) self-energy diagrams in a system. These diagrams represent the effects of interactions between particles on the energy and width of a particle.

The physical interpretation of the self-energy is closely related to the concept of the Green's function, which describes the propagation of a particle in a system. The Green's function, denoted by $G$, is defined as the inverse of the self-energy, i.e., $G = (1 - \Sigma)^{-1}$. This relationship shows that the self-energy plays a crucial role in determining the propagation of particles in a system.

The self-energy can be interpreted as the energy and width of a particle in a system, due to its interactions with other particles. The real part of the self-energy represents the energy shift of a particle, while the imaginary part represents the width of a particle. The width of a particle is related to the lifetime of the particle, with a wider particle having a shorter lifetime.

In many-body theory, the self-energy is often calculated using perturbation theory, where it is treated as a small correction to the non-interacting system. This allows us to systematically calculate the effects of interactions on the properties of a system. However, in some cases, such as in strongly correlated systems, the self-energy may need to be calculated using non-perturbative methods.

In the next section, we will explore the calculation of the self-energy in more detail, and discuss its applications in many-body theory.




### Subsection: 3.3b Dyson Equation for Self-Energy

The Dyson equation is a fundamental equation in many-body theory that relates the self-energy of a particle to the Green's function of the system. It is named after the British physicist Freeman Dyson, who first derived it in the 1940s. The Dyson equation is a key tool in the calculation of the self-energy and is used extensively in many-body perturbation theory.

#### 3.3b Dyson Equation for Self-Energy

The Dyson equation for the self-energy is given by:

$$
\Sigma(k) = \int \frac{d^4p}{(2\pi)^4} G(p) \Gamma(p,k)
$$

where $k$ is the momentum of the particle, $p$ is the momentum of the interacting particle, $G(p)$ is the Green's function, and $\Gamma(p,k)$ is the vertex function. The vertex function describes the interaction between the particle and the interacting particle.

The Dyson equation can be understood as a sum over all the one-particle irreducible self-energy diagrams in a system. Each term in the sum represents a different way in which the particle can interact with the other particles in the system. The Green's function and the vertex function are used to calculate the contribution of each term to the self-energy.

The Dyson equation is a powerful tool in many-body theory, as it allows us to systematically calculate the effects of interactions on the self-energy of a particle. However, it is also a complex equation, and its application requires a deep understanding of many-body theory and perturbation theory. In the following sections, we will explore the Dyson equation in more detail and discuss its applications in many-body theory.





#### 3.3c Diagrammatic Expansion of Self-Energy

In the previous section, we discussed the Dyson equation for the self-energy. In this section, we will explore the diagrammatic expansion of the self-energy, which is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

The diagrammatic expansion of the self-energy is based on the concept of Feynman diagrams, which were first introduced by Richard Feynman in the 1940s. Feynman diagrams are a graphical representation of the interactions between particles in a system. They allow us to visualize the complex interactions between particles and to calculate the effects of these interactions on the behavior of the system.

The self-energy of a particle can be represented as a Feynman diagram, where the particle is represented by a line and the interactions with other particles are represented by vertices. The self-energy is then calculated by summing over all possible Feynman diagrams.

The diagrammatic expansion of the self-energy can be understood as a series of nested loops, where each loop represents a different interaction between particles. The first loop represents the interaction between the particle and the other particles in the system, the second loop represents the interaction between the particles in the first loop and the other particles in the system, and so on.

The diagrammatic expansion of the self-energy can be written as:

$$
\Sigma(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-i)^n}{n!} \int \frac{d^4p_1}{(2\pi)^4} \cdots \frac{d^4p_n}{(2\pi)^4} G(p_1) \cdots G(p_n) \Gamma(p_1,k) \cdots \Gamma(p_n,k)
$$

where $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ are the momenta of the interacting particles and $\Gamma(p_1,k),\ldots,\Gamma(p_n,k)$ are the vertex functions.

The diagrammatic expansion of the self-energy allows us to systematically calculate the effects of interactions on the behavior of a many-body system. It also provides a visual representation of the interactions between particles, making it a useful tool for understanding the behavior of complex systems.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the diagrammatic expansion of the self-energy in the context of many-body perturbation theory. We will see how this powerful tool can be used to calculate the effects of interactions on the behavior of a many-body system.





#### 3.3d Applications of Self-Energy in Many-Body Systems

The self-energy is a fundamental concept in many-body theory, and it has a wide range of applications in condensed matter systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the Hubbard model and the Rayleigh theorem for eigenvalues.

##### The Hubbard Model

The Hubbard model is a simple model of interacting electrons in a lattice. It is defined by the Hamiltonian:

$$
H = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} (c_i^\dagger c_j + h.c.) + U \sum_i n_i^2
$$

where $c_i^\dagger$ and $c_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron at site $i$, $t$ is the hopping energy, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb interaction, and $n_i = c_i^\dagger c_i$ is the number operator.

The self-energy in the Hubbard model can be calculated using the diagrammatic expansion discussed in the previous section. The first few terms of the expansion are:

$$
\Sigma(k) = \frac{U}{2} \sum_p G(p) G(p+k) + \frac{U^2}{4} \sum_{p,p'} G(p) G(p+k) G(p') G(p'+k) + \cdots
$$

This expansion allows us to calculate the effects of the interactions between electrons on their propagation through the lattice. It is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of the system at different values of the interaction strength $U$.

##### The Rayleigh Theorem for Eigenvalues

The Rayleigh theorem for eigenvalues is a powerful tool for finding the ground state of a system in density functional theory (DFT). It allows us to minimize the energy of the system by varying the basis set, as discussed in the previous section.

The self-energy plays a crucial role in the Rayleigh theorem. The occupied energies from successive calculations with augmented basis sets are compared to determine the ground state of the system. The self-energy is used to calculate these energies, and its diagrammatic expansion allows us to systematically calculate the effects of the interactions between particles on the energy of the system.

In conclusion, the self-energy is a fundamental concept in many-body theory, with wide-ranging applications in condensed matter systems. Its diagrammatic expansion provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of these systems, and its role in the Rayleigh theorem for eigenvalues allows us to find the ground state of a system in DFT.

#### 3.4a Green's Function Techniques in Many-Body Theory

Green's function techniques are a powerful tool in many-body theory, providing a systematic way to calculate the effects of interactions between particles on the propagation of these particles. In this section, we will introduce the basic definitions and properties of Green's functions, and discuss how they can be used to calculate the self-energy and other physical quantities.

##### Basic Definitions

In many-body theory, we often deal with systems of interacting particles. These interactions can be described by field operators, which act on the state of the system and determine how the system evolves over time. The field operators can be represented as a matrix, with each element representing the state of a particle.

The Green's function, denoted as $\mathcal{G}$, is a matrix that describes the propagation of these particles. It is defined as the inverse of the matrix of field operators, and can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
\mathcal{G} = (\mathbb{I} - \mathcal{G}_0 \mathcal{G}_1)^{-1} \mathcal{G}_0
$$

where $\mathcal{G}_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function, and $\mathcal{G}_1$ is the perturbation due to the interactions between particles.

##### Properties of Green's Functions

Green's functions have several important properties that make them useful in many-body theory. These include:

1. Causality: The Green's function is causal, meaning that it vanishes for negative times. This is a consequence of the fact that the field operators are Hermitian, and ensures that the propagation of particles is consistent with causality.

2. Analyticity: The Green's function is an analytic function of the frequency variable $\omega$ in the complex plane, except for a set of isolated poles. These poles correspond to the energies of the particles in the system, and their residues give the probability amplitudes for the particles to be in these states.

3. Periodicity: The Green's function is periodic in the frequency variable, with a period of $2\pi i$. This property is a consequence of the periodicity of the field operators, and allows us to express the Green's function in terms of a single-valued function.

##### Calculating Physical Quantities

Green's function techniques can be used to calculate a wide range of physical quantities in many-body theory. One of the most important of these is the self-energy, which describes the effects of the interactions between particles on the propagation of these particles.

The self-energy can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
\Sigma = \mathcal{G}_1 \mathcal{G}_0

This equation allows us to systematically calculate the effects of the interactions between particles on the propagation of these particles. It is a key tool in many-body theory, and is used in a wide range of applications, from the study of phase transitions to the calculation of physical properties of materials.

#### 3.4b Retarded, Advanced, and Keldysh Green's Functions

In the previous section, we introduced the basic definitions and properties of Green's functions. In this section, we will delve deeper into the different types of Green's functions, namely the retarded, advanced, and Keldysh Green's functions.

##### Retarded Green's Function

The retarded Green's function, denoted as $G^R$, describes the propagation of particles in the absence of any external perturbations. It is defined as the inverse of the matrix of field operators in the absence of any interactions, and can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
G^R = (\mathbb{I} - G_0^R G_1^R)^{-1} G_0^R
$$

where $G_0^R$ is the non-interacting retarded Green's function, and $G_1^R$ is the perturbation due to the interactions between particles.

The retarded Green's function is particularly useful in the study of quantum mechanics, where it is used to calculate the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from one point to another.

##### Advanced Green's Function

The advanced Green's function, denoted as $G^A$, describes the propagation of particles in the presence of an external perturbation. It is defined as the inverse of the matrix of field operators in the presence of the perturbation, and can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
G^A = (\mathbb{I} - G_0^A G_1^A)^{-1} G_0^A
$$

where $G_0^A$ is the non-interacting advanced Green's function, and $G_1^A$ is the perturbation due to the interactions between particles.

The advanced Green's function is particularly useful in the study of quantum field theory, where it is used to calculate the response of a system to an external perturbation.

##### Keldysh Green's Function

The Keldysh Green's function, denoted as $G^K$, is a generalization of the retarded and advanced Green's functions. It describes the propagation of particles in the presence of an external perturbation, and takes into account the correlations between the particles.

The Keldysh Green's function is defined as the inverse of the matrix of field operators in the presence of the perturbation, and can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
G^K = (\mathbb{I} - G_0^K G_1^K)^{-1} G_0^K
$$

where $G_0^K$ is the non-interacting Keldysh Green's function, and $G_1^K$ is the perturbation due to the interactions between particles.

The Keldysh Green's function is particularly useful in the study of non-equilibrium quantum mechanics, where it is used to calculate the response of a system to an external perturbation while taking into account the correlations between the particles.

In the next section, we will discuss how these different types of Green's functions can be used to calculate physical quantities in many-body theory.

#### 3.4c Green's Function Techniques in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, Green's function techniques are used to study the electronic band structure of materials. The Green's function, denoted as $G$, is a matrix that describes the propagation of electrons in a material. It is defined as the inverse of the matrix of field operators, and can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
G = (\mathbb{I} - G_0 G_1)^{-1} G_0
$$

where $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function, and $G_1$ is the perturbation due to the interactions between electrons.

The Green's function is particularly useful in the study of quantum mechanics, where it is used to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to propagate from one point to another. In condensed matter physics, the Green's function is used to calculate the electronic band structure of a material, which describes the allowed energy levels of electrons in a material.

The Green's function can also be used to calculate other physical quantities, such as the self-energy of an electron, which describes the interaction of an electron with the rest of the material. The self-energy can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
\Sigma = G_0 G_1
$$

The Green's function techniques are also used in condensed matter physics to study the effects of interactions between electrons on the electronic band structure of a material. This is done by including the interaction term $G_1$ in the Dyson equation, which accounts for the correlations between electrons.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of Green's function techniques in condensed matter physics, focusing on the calculation of physical quantities such as the electronic band structure and the self-energy of electrons.




#### 3.4c Diagrammatic Techniques for Green's Functions

In the previous sections, we have discussed the basic definitions and properties of Green's functions, as well as the different types of Green's functions. In this section, we will explore the diagrammatic techniques used to calculate Green's functions, specifically the Feynman diagrams.

##### Feynman Diagrams

Feynman diagrams are a powerful tool in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, used to visualize and calculate the probability amplitudes for particle interactions. They were first introduced by Richard Feynman in the 1940s, and have since become an essential tool in many-body theory.

A Feynman diagram is a graph, where the nodes represent particles and the edges represent interactions between these particles. The direction of the edges represents the direction of time, with the past at the bottom and the future at the top. The lines representing particles are called world lines, and the vertices where the lines meet are called interaction points.

The probability amplitude for a particle interaction can be calculated by summing over all possible Feynman diagrams for that interaction. This is known as the Feynman sum rule.

##### Green's Functions and Feynman Diagrams

Green's functions can also be represented using Feynman diagrams. The retarded, advanced, and Keldysh Green's functions can be represented as the propagators of particles in the absence or presence of external perturbations.

For example, the retarded Green's function $G^R$ can be represented as a Feynman diagram where the world lines of two particles meet at an interaction point, with an arrow pointing from the past to the future. This represents the propagation of a particle from the past to the future, without any external perturbations.

Similarly, the advanced Green's function $G^A$ can be represented as a Feynman diagram where the world lines of two particles meet at an interaction point, with an arrow pointing from the future to the past. This represents the propagation of a particle from the future to the past, with an external perturbation.

The Keldysh Green's function $G^K$ can be represented as a Feynman diagram where the world lines of two particles meet at an interaction point, with two arrows pointing from the past to the future. This represents the propagation of a particle from the past to the future, with correlations between the particles.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of these diagrammatic techniques in many-body theory.




#### 3.4d Applications of Green's Function Techniques in Condensed Matter Physics

Green's function techniques have been widely used in condensed matter physics to study the electronic band structure of materials. The band structure describes the allowed energy levels of electrons in a material, and it is crucial for understanding the electronic properties of materials.

##### Band Structure Calculations

The band structure of a material can be calculated using the Green's function formalism. The Green's function $G$ is defined as the inverse of the Hamiltonian matrix $H$:

$$
G = (E - H)^{-1}
$$

where $E$ is the energy of the electrons. The Green's function can then be used to calculate the band structure by finding the poles of the Green's function, which correspond to the allowed energy levels of the electrons.

##### Many-Body Perturbation Theory

Many-body perturbation theory is a powerful tool for studying the electronic properties of materials. It allows us to calculate the effects of interactions between electrons on the band structure and other properties of materials.

The Green's function formalism is particularly useful for many-body perturbation theory, as it allows us to calculate the self-energy of the electrons, which describes the effects of the interactions between electrons. The self-energy can be calculated using the Dyson equation:

$$
G = G_0 + G_0 \Sigma G
$$

where $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function and $\Sigma$ is the self-energy. This equation allows us to calculate the self-energy iteratively, taking into account the effects of the interactions between electrons.

##### Diagrammatic Techniques

Diagrammatic techniques, such as Feynman diagrams, are often used in many-body perturbation theory to calculate the self-energy and other properties of materials. These techniques allow us to systematically calculate the effects of interactions between electrons on the band structure and other properties of materials.

In conclusion, Green's function techniques have been widely used in condensed matter physics to study the electronic band structure of materials.

## Chapter 4: Many-Body Theory of Metals

### Introduction

The study of metals is a fundamental aspect of condensed matter physics. The behavior of electrons in metals, particularly their collective behavior, is of great interest due to its implications for a wide range of physical phenomena, from superconductivity to the electrical conductivity of materials. In this chapter, we will delve into the many-body theory of metals, a theoretical framework that provides a comprehensive understanding of the collective behavior of electrons in metals.

The many-body theory of metals is a branch of condensed matter physics that deals with the behavior of a large number of interacting particles, such as electrons, in a metal. It is a quantum mechanical theory that takes into account the interactions between all the particles in the system, hence the term "many-body". This theory is particularly useful in understanding the electronic properties of metals, such as their band structure, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of the many-body theory of metals, including the concept of the band structure, the role of interactions between electrons, and the implications of these interactions for the properties of metals. We will also discuss some of the key applications of this theory, such as the study of metals near phase transitions and the study of metals with strong correlations between electrons.

The many-body theory of metals is a complex and rich field, with many interesting and important applications. By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the basic principles of this theory and be able to apply these principles to understand the behavior of metals. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the many-body theory of metals.

It is particularly useful in condensed matter physics, where it has been used to study a wide range of systems, from metals to insulators.

### Introduction

In the realm of condensed matter physics, the concept of many-body systems is fundamental. These systems are characterized by a large number of interacting particles, and their behavior cannot be fully understood by studying the individual particles.

The Green's function, named after the British mathematician George Green, is a mathematical function that describes the propagation of a disturbance in a system. In the context of many-body systems, it provides a powerful tool for studying the collective behavior of the system.

##### RPA for Electron-Phonon-Exciton Interactions

The RPA provides a way to calculate the effects of electron-phonon-exciton interactions on the electronic band structure of a semiconductor. This is done by solving the RPA equations, which are a set of self-consistent integro-differential equations that describe the interactions between electrons, phonons, and excitons.

The RPA equations for electron-phonon-exciton interactions can be written as:

$$
\chi_0(\omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \Sigma(\omega)}
$$

where $\chi_0(\omega)$ is the non-interacting susceptibility, $\omega$ is the frequency, and $\Sigma(\omega)$ is the self-energy. The self-energy accounts for the interactions between electrons, phonons, and excitons and is given by:

$$
\Sigma(\omega) = \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_n e^{i\omega_n 0^+} \chi(\omega_n)
$$

where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, $\omega_n$ are the Matsubara frequencies, and $\chi(\omega_n)$ is the interacting susceptibility.

##### Physical Interpretation of RPA for Electron-Phonon-Exciton Interactions

The RPA for electron-phonon-exciton interactions can be understood in terms of the mean-field approximation. In the mean-field approximation, the electrons, phonons, and excitons in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other electrons, phonons, and excitons, rather than the individual interactions between them.

In the RPA, the mean field is represented by the random phase approximation, which assumes that the electrons, phonons, and excitons in the system are in a random phase with each other. This is a reasonable assumption for systems with a large number of these particles, where the interactions between them are likely to be random and uncorrelated.

The RPA can be understood as a generalization of the mean-field approximation, where the mean field is not just the average field, but also includes the correlations between electrons, phonons, and excitons. This makes it particularly useful for studying systems with strong electron-phonon-exciton interactions, where the mean-field approximation may not be sufficient.

## Chapter: - Chapter 4: Mean Field Theory:




### Section: 4.1 Hartree-Fock Approximation:

The Hartree-Fock approximation is a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems, providing a simplified yet accurate description of the behavior of these complex systems. It is based on the mean field theory, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles. This allows us to solve the equations of motion analytically, making it a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

#### 4.1a Hartree-Fock Self-Consistent Field Method

The Hartree-Fock approximation is based on the mean field theory, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles. This allows us to solve the equations of motion analytically, making it a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

The Hartree-Fock approximation is based on the following assumptions:

1. The wave function of the system can be written as a single Slater determinant, which is a product of one-particle wave functions. This assumption is based on the antisymmetry principle of quantum mechanics.
2. The one-particle wave functions are determined by minimizing the total energy of the system. This is achieved by solving the Hartree-Fock equations, which are a set of self-consistent integro-differential equations.
3. The one-particle wave functions are orthogonal to each other. This is a consequence of the antisymmetry principle and ensures that the wave function is properly normalized.

The Hartree-Fock equations can be written as:

$$
\hat{H}\psi_i = \epsilon_i\psi_i
$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the one-body Hamiltonian, $\psi_i$ is the one-particle wave function, and $\epsilon_i$ is the one-particle energy. These equations can be solved iteratively to obtain the one-particle wave functions and energies.

The Hartree-Fock approximation has been successfully applied to a wide range of systems, including atoms, molecules, and solids. It has also been extended to include correlations between particles, leading to the post-Hartree-Fock methods such as Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and coupled cluster theory. These methods provide a more accurate description of the system, but at the cost of increased computational complexity.

In the next section, we will explore the Hartree-Fock approximation in more detail, including its applications and limitations. We will also discuss the post-Hartree-Fock methods and their role in many-body theory.

The Hartree-Fock equations can be written as:

$$
\hat{H}\psi_i = \epsilon_i\psi_i
$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the one-body Hamiltonian, $\psi_i$ is the one-particle wave function, and $\epsilon_i$ is the one-particle energy. These equations can be solved iteratively to obtain the one-particle wave functions and energies.

The Hartree-Fock approximation is particularly useful for systems with a large number of particles, where the interactions between particles become too complex to be solved analytically. It provides a mean field description of the system, where each particle experiences an average field created by all the other particles. This allows us to understand the behavior of many-body systems in a simplified yet accurate manner.

#### 4.1b Hartree-Fock Approximation for Electron-Electron Interactions

The Hartree-Fock approximation is particularly useful for understanding electron-electron interactions in many-body systems. In this case, the one-body Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ includes the Coulomb interaction between electrons. The Hartree-Fock equations then describe how the electrons in the system interact with each other through this average Coulomb field.

The Hartree-Fock equations for electron-electron interactions can be written as:

$$
\hat{H}\psi_i = \epsilon_i\psi_i + \int d^3x\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\rho(\vec{x})}{|\vec{x}-\vec{x}_i|}\psi_i(\vec{x}_i)
$$

where $\rho(\vec{x})$ is the electron density at position $\vec{x}$, and $\vec{x}_i$ is the position of the $i$-th electron. This equation describes how the one-particle wave function $\psi_i$ is influenced by the average Coulomb field created by all the other electrons in the system.

The Hartree-Fock approximation for electron-electron interactions is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of systems with a large number of electrons, such as metals. It provides a mean field description of the system, where each electron experiences an average Coulomb field created by all the other electrons. This allows us to understand the behavior of many-body systems in a simplified yet accurate manner.

In the next section, we will discuss the GW approximation, another powerful tool for understanding many-body systems.




### Section: 4.1c Mean Field Approximation for Electron-Phonon Interactions

The mean field approximation is a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems, providing a simplified yet accurate description of the behavior of these complex systems. It is based on the mean field theory, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles. This allows us to solve the equations of motion analytically, making it a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

In the context of electron-phonon interactions, the mean field approximation is particularly useful. Phonons are collective oscillations of atoms in a crystal lattice, and they play a crucial role in many physical properties of materials, such as thermal and electrical conductivity. The interaction between electrons and phonons is of great interest due to its importance in various phenomena, such as electron-phonon scattering and the electron-phonon coupling constant.

The mean field approximation for electron-phonon interactions is based on the following assumptions:

1. The wave function of the system can be written as a single Slater determinant, which is a product of one-particle wave functions. This assumption is based on the antisymmetry principle of quantum mechanics.
2. The one-particle wave functions are determined by minimizing the total energy of the system. This is achieved by solving the Hartree-Fock equations, which are a set of self-consistent integro-differential equations.
3. The one-particle wave functions are orthogonal to each other. This is a consequence of the antisymmetry principle and ensures that the wave function is properly normalized.

The Hartree-Fock equations for electron-phonon interactions can be written as:

$$
\hat{H}\psi_i = \epsilon_i\psi_i
$$

where $\hat{H}$ is the one-body Hamiltonian, $\psi_i$ is the one-particle wave function, and $\epsilon_i$ is the one-particle energy. These equations can be solved iteratively to obtain the one-particle wave functions and the electron-phonon coupling constant.

The mean field approximation for electron-phonon interactions is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems. It allows us to simplify complex systems and solve the equations of motion analytically, providing valuable insights into the behavior of these systems.

### Subsection: 4.2a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Equations for Superconductors

The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations are a powerful tool in the study of superconductors. They are a set of coupled integro-differential equations that describe the behavior of the electron and hole components of the superconducting wave function. These equations are derived from the mean field theory, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles.

The BdG equations for superconductors can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left[ \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}} - \mu \right] c_{\mathbf{k}} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}'} V_{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'} c_{\mathbf{k}'} &= 0 \\
\left[ \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}} - \mu \right] c_{\mathbf{k}} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}'} V_{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'} c_{\mathbf{k}'} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the energy of the electron with wave vector $\mathbf{k}$, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $V_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the Coulomb matrix element. The symbolically denoted $\left. \cdots \right|_{\mathrm{scatter}}$ contributions stem from the hierarchical coupling due to many-body interactions. Conceptually, $c_\mathbf{k}$, $f^e_{\mathbf k}$, and $f^h_{\mathbf k}$ are single-particle expectation values while the hierarchical coupling originates from two-particle correlations such as polarization-density correlations or polarization-phonon correlations. Physically, these two-particle correlations introduce several nontrivial effects such as screening of Coulomb interaction, Boltzmann-type scattering of $f^{e}_{\mathbf{k}}$ and $f^{h}_{\mathbf{k}}$ toward Fermi–Dirac distribution, excitation-induced dephasing, and further renormalization of energies due to correlations.

All these correlation effects can be systematically included by solving the BdG equations. This allows us to study the properties of superconductors, such as the critical temperature at which superconductivity occurs, the energy gap, and the behavior of the superconducting wave function. The BdG equations are a fundamental tool in the study of superconductors and are essential for understanding the behavior of these fascinating materials.





### Subsection: 4.2b BCS Theory and Its Physical Interpretation

The BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory is a groundbreaking theory in condensed matter physics that provides a microscopic explanation for superconductivity. It was proposed by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer in 1957, and it was the first theory to successfully explain the phenomenon of superconductivity.

The BCS theory is based on the mean field theory, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles. This assumption allows us to derive the BCS equations, which describe the behavior of the electron and hole components of the superconducting wave function.

The BCS equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left[ \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}} - \mu \right] c_{\mathbf{k}} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}'} V_{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'} c_{\mathbf{k}'} &= 0 \\
\left[ \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}} - \mu \right] c_{\mathbf{k}} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}'} V_{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'} c_{\mathbf{k}'} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the energy of the electron with wave vector $\mathbf{k}$, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $V_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the Coulomb matrix element. The symbolically denoted $\left. \cdots \right|_{\mathrm{scatter}}$ contributions stem from the hierarchical coupling due to many-body interactions. Conceptually, $c_\mathbf{k}$, $f^e_{\mathbf k}$, and $f^h_{\mathbf k}$ are single-particle expectation values while the hierarchical coupling originates from two-particle correlations such as polarization-density correlations or polarization-phonon correlations. Physically, these two-particle correlations introduce several nontrivial effects such as screening of Coulomb interaction, Boltzmann-type scattering of $f^{e}_{\mathbf{k}}$ and $f^{h}_{\mathbf{k}}$ toward Fermi–Dirac distribution, excitation-induced dephasing, and further renormalization of energies due to correlations.

The BCS theory provides a physical interpretation of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. It explains how the electron and hole components of the superconducting wave function interact with each other to form Cooper pairs, which are the fundamental building blocks of superconductivity. These Cooper pairs are bosonic in nature, and they are responsible for the macroscopic quantum coherence that characterizes superconductivity.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of the BCS theory and its physical interpretation. We will explore how the BCS theory explains the phenomenon of superconductivity, and we will discuss the implications of this theory for the study of condensed matter systems.




### Subsection: 4.2c Mean Field Approximation for Superconducting Systems

The mean field approximation is a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems, including superconducting systems. It allows us to simplify the complex interactions between many particles by treating them as an average field acting on each particle. This approximation is particularly useful in the study of superconductivity, where it provides a microscopic explanation for the phenomenon.

The mean field approximation for superconducting systems is based on the BCS theory. In this theory, the wave function of the system is represented as a linear combination of the electron and hole components, which are the electron and hole states of the system. The mean field approximation then allows us to derive the BCS equations, which describe the behavior of these components.

The BCS equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left[ \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}} - \mu \right] c_{\mathbf{k}} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}'} V_{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'} c_{\mathbf{k}'} &= 0 \\
\left[ \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}} - \mu \right] c_{\mathbf{k}} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}'} V_{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'} c_{\mathbf{k}'} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the energy of the electron with wave vector $\mathbf{k}$, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $V_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the Coulomb matrix element. The symbolically denoted $\left. \cdots \right|_{\mathrm{scatter}}$ contributions stem from the hierarchical coupling due to many-body interactions. Conceptually, $c_\mathbf{k}$, $f^e_{\mathbf k}$, and $f^h_{\mathbf k}$ are single-particle expectation values while the hierarchical coupling originates from two-particle correlations such as polarization-density correlations or polarization-phonon correlations. Physically, these two-particle correlations introduce several nontrivial effects such as screening of Coulomb interaction, Boltzmann-type scattering of $f^{e}_{\mathbf{k}}$ and $f^{h}_{\mathbf{k}}$ toward Fermi–Dirac distribution, excitation-induced dephasing, and further renormalization of the one-body Green's function.

The mean field approximation for superconducting systems is a powerful tool that allows us to understand the behavior of these systems at a microscopic level. It provides a foundation for further studies of superconductivity and other many-body systems.




### Subsection: 4.2d Applications of Bogoliubov-de Gennes Equations in Condensed Matter Physics

The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations are a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems, particularly in condensed matter physics. They provide a mean field theory that allows us to simplify the complex interactions between many particles by treating them as an average field acting on each particle. This approximation is particularly useful in the study of superconductivity, where it provides a microscopic explanation for the phenomenon.

The BdG equations are derived from the mean field approximation and are used to describe the behavior of electrons in a system. They are particularly useful in condensed matter systems, where they can be used to describe the behavior of electrons in a metal or semiconductor.

The BdG equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left[ \varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}} - \mu \right] c_{\mathbf{k}} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}'} V_{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'} c_{\mathbf{k}'} &= 0 \\

\end{align*}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the energy of the electron with wave vector $\mathbf{k}$, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $V_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the Coulomb matrix element. The symbolically denoted $\left. \cdots \right|_{\mathrm{scatter}}$ contributions stem from the hierarchical coupling due to many-body interactions.

The BdG equations have been used to study a wide range of condensed matter systems, including superconductors, metals, and semiconductors. They have been particularly useful in the study of superconductivity, where they have provided a microscopic explanation for the phenomenon. The BdG equations have also been used to study the behavior of electrons in semiconductors, where they have provided insights into the behavior of electrons in the presence of an external electric field.

In addition to their applications in condensed matter systems, the BdG equations have also been used in other areas of physics, including nuclear physics and quantum mechanics. They have been particularly useful in the study of nuclear systems, where they have provided a mean field theory that allows us to simplify the complex interactions between many particles.

In conclusion, the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems, particularly in condensed matter physics. They have been used to study a wide range of systems and have provided valuable insights into the behavior of electrons in these systems.




### Subsection: 4.3a BCS Theory of Superconductivity

The BCS theory, named after its developers John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer, is a microscopic theory that explains the phenomenon of superconductivity. It is based on the mean field theory and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which we have discussed in the previous sections.

The BCS theory is based on the following assumptions:

1. The wave function of the system can be written as a linear combination of two states, one with all electrons in the lower energy band and the other with all electrons in the upper energy band. This assumption is based on the fact that in a superconductor, all electrons are paired and occupy the lower energy band.

2. The one-body Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
\hat{H}_1 = \sum_{k,\sigma} \epsilon_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,\sigma}
$$

where $\epsilon_k$ is the one-body energy of the electron with wave vector $k$.

3. The two-body interaction Hamiltonian is given by:

$$
\hat{H}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k,k',\sigma,\sigma'} V_{k,k'} c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k',\sigma'} c_{k',\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,\sigma}
$$

where $V_{k,k'}$ is the two-body interaction matrix element.

4. The one-body potential is given by:

$$
\hat{V}_1 = \sum_{k,\sigma} \epsilon_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,\sigma}
$$

where $\epsilon_k$ is the one-body energy of the electron with wave vector $k$.

5. The two-body potential is given by:

$$
\hat{V}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k,k',\sigma,\sigma'} V_{k,k'} c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k',\sigma'} c_{k',\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,\sigma}
$$

where $V_{k,k'}$ is the two-body interaction matrix element.

The BCS theory then proceeds to solve the BdG equations for the one-body potential, taking into account the two-body interaction. This leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons with opposite spin and momentum that are bound together by the attractive interaction between their spins. These Cooper pairs are responsible for the superconducting state, where all electrons are paired and the system is in a state of zero net spin.

The BCS theory has been successful in explaining many properties of superconductors, including the critical temperature below which superconductivity occurs, the energy gap that separates the superconducting state from the normal state, and the behavior of the superconducting state near the critical temperature. However, it has some limitations, particularly in explaining high-temperature superconductivity, where other theories and models are needed.




### Subsection: 4.3b Cooper Pairs and BCS Wavefunction

The BCS theory is based on the concept of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons with opposite spin and momentum that are bound together by the attractive interaction between their spins. This concept is central to the understanding of superconductivity.

The wave function of the BCS theory is given by:

$$
\Psi(\{x_i\}) = \prod_{k,\sigma} (u_k + v_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger}) |0\rangle
$$

where $u_k$ and $v_k$ are complex numbers, $c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger}$ and $c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger}$ are the creation operators for electrons with spin $\sigma$ and momentum $k$, and $|0\rangle$ is the vacuum state.

The BCS wave function describes a state in which all the electrons are in Cooper pairs, with the wave function of each pair given by:

$$
\Psi_{k,\sigma} = u_k + v_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger}
$$

The coefficients $u_k$ and $v_k$ are determined by minimizing the total energy of the system, which is given by:

$$
E = \sum_{k,\sigma} \epsilon_k |u_k|^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k,k',\sigma,\sigma'} V_{k,k'} |u_k|^2 |u_{k'}|^2
$$

where $\epsilon_k$ is the one-body energy of the electron with wave vector $k$, and $V_{k,k'}$ is the two-body interaction matrix element.

The BCS theory predicts that the energy gap, which is the minimum energy required to break a Cooper pair, is given by:

$$
\Delta = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k,\sigma} V_{k,k'} |u_k|^2 |u_{k'}|^2
$$

This energy gap is the key to understanding the behavior of superconductors. It leads to the Meissner effect, in which magnetic fields are expelled from the interior of a superconductor, and to the BCS ground state, which is a state of zero entropy and perfect diamagnetism.

The BCS theory has been successful in explaining many of the properties of superconductors, including the energy gap, the Meissner effect, and the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. However, it has also been the subject of much debate and research, with many questions remaining about its applicability to real materials and its underlying assumptions.




### Subsection: 4.3c Mean Field Approximation for Superconductors

The mean field approximation is a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems, including superconductors. It allows us to simplify the complex interactions between many particles by treating them as an average field acting on each particle. This approximation is particularly useful in the study of superconductors, where the interactions between electrons can lead to the formation of Cooper pairs and the emergence of superconductivity.

The mean field approximation for superconductors is based on the BCS theory, which describes the ground state of a superconductor as a state of Cooper pairs. In this theory, the wave function of the system is given by:

$$
\Psi(\{x_i\}) = \prod_{k,\sigma} (u_k + v_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger}) |0\rangle
$$

where $u_k$ and $v_k$ are complex numbers, $c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger}$ and $c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger}$ are the creation operators for electrons with spin $\sigma$ and momentum $k$, and $|0\rangle$ is the vacuum state.

The mean field approximation simplifies the calculation of the total energy of the system by treating the interactions between electrons as an average field acting on each electron. This leads to the following expression for the total energy:

$$
E = \sum_{k,\sigma} \epsilon_k |u_k|^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k,k',\sigma,\sigma'} V_{k,k'} |u_k|^2 |u_{k'}|^2
$$

where $\epsilon_k$ is the one-body energy of the electron with wave vector $k$, and $V_{k,k'}$ is the two-body interaction matrix element.

The mean field approximation also simplifies the calculation of the wave function of the system. In the BCS theory, the wave function of each Cooper pair is given by:

$$
\Psi_{k,\sigma} = u_k + v_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger}
$$

In the mean field approximation, this wave function is replaced by a simpler form:

$$
\Psi_{k,\sigma} = u_k + v_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k',\sigma'} V_{k,k'} |u_{k'}|^2 c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,-\sigma}^{\dagger}
$$

This approximation allows us to calculate the properties of the superconductor, such as the energy gap and the Meissner effect, in a simpler and more tractable manner. However, it is important to note that the mean field approximation is an approximation, and it may not accurately capture the behavior of the system in all cases.




### Subsection: 4.3d Applications of BCS Theory in Condensed Matter Physics

### Subsection: 4.4a Ginzburg-Landau Theory and Its Physical Interpretation

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is a phenomenological theory that describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It is named after the physicists Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg who first proposed it in 1950. The theory is based on the mean field approximation, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is particularly useful in the study of superconductivity because it provides a way to understand the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature, where the superconducting state is fragile and can easily be disrupted by small perturbations. The theory is based on the concept of an order parameter, which is a complex-valued function that describes the state of the system. In the case of superconductivity, the order parameter is the wave function of the Cooper pairs.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is based on the following assumptions:

1. The order parameter is a complex-valued function that describes the state of the system.
2. The order parameter is smooth and continuous.
3. The order parameter is zero in the normal phase and non-zero in the superconducting phase.
4. The order parameter is complex-valued, reflecting the fact that the superconducting state is a coherent state of Cooper pairs.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to derive the equations of motion for the order parameter, which describe how the order parameter evolves over time. These equations can be used to study the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature, and to understand the conditions under which the superconducting state can be stabilized.

The physical interpretation of the Ginzburg-Landau theory is that it provides a way to understand the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. The theory describes the transition from the normal phase to the superconducting phase as a continuous process, where the order parameter gradually changes from zero to a non-zero value. This interpretation is consistent with the experimental observations of the superconducting phase transition, which is typically a continuous process.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of the Ginzburg-Landau theory in the study of superconductivity.




### Subsection: 4.4b Landau-Ginzburg Free Energy Functional

The Landau-Ginzburg free energy functional is a key component of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. It is a mathematical function that describes the energy of the system in terms of the order parameter. The functional is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{F}[\psi] = \int \left[ \alpha \vert \psi \vert^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} \vert \psi \vert^4 + \frac{1}{2} \vert (\nabla - \frac{ie}{\hbar c} \mathbf{A}) \psi \vert^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \vert \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \vert^2 \right] d^3x
$$

where $\psi$ is the order parameter, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $c$ is the speed of light, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

The first two terms in the functional represent the potential energy of the system, with the first term representing the kinetic energy and the second term representing the potential energy due to the interactions between the particles. The third term represents the kinetic energy of the particles, and the fourth term represents the magnetic energy of the system.

The Landau-Ginzburg free energy functional is used to derive the equations of motion for the order parameter, which describe how the order parameter evolves over time. These equations can be used to study the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature, and to understand the conditions under which the superconducting state can be stabilized.

The physical interpretation of the Landau-Ginzburg free energy functional is that it provides a way to understand the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. The functional can be used to calculate the energy of the system, and to understand how the energy changes as the system evolves over time. This provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature, and can help to explain the phenomena observed in these systems.




### Subsection: 4.4c Order Parameter and Phase Transitions

The order parameter, denoted by $\psi$, plays a crucial role in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. It is a complex-valued function that describes the state of the system, and its magnitude and phase are related to the order of the system. The order parameter is defined as:

$$
\psi(\mathbf{x}) = \sqrt{\rho(\mathbf{x})}e^{i\theta(\mathbf{x})}
$$

where $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ is the density of the particles at position $\mathbf{x}$, and $\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is the phase of the particles at position $\mathbf{x}$.

The order parameter is used to define the order parameter field, which is a function of position and time. The order parameter field is defined as:

$$

$$

where $\mu$ is the chemical potential.

The order parameter field is used to define the order parameter current, which is a function of position and time. The order parameter current is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\nabla\psi^*\psi - \frac{e}{mc}\psi^*\psi\mathbf{A}
$$

where $\psi^*$ is the complex conjugate of the order parameter, $\nabla$ is the gradient operator, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $m$ is the mass of the electron, $c$ is the speed of light, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.

The order parameter current is used to define the order parameter current density, which is a function of position and time. The order parameter current density is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\nabla\psi^*\psi - \frac{e}{mc}\psi^*\psi\mathbf{A}
$$

The order parameter current density is used to define the order parameter current density field, which is a function of position and time. The order parameter current density field is defined as:

$$

$$

$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\nabla\psi^*\psi - \frac{e}{mc}\psi^*\psi\mathbf{A}
$$

The order parameter current density field strength is used to define the order parameter current density field strength field, which is a function of position and time. The order parameter current density field strength field is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\nabla\psi^*\psi - \frac{e}{mc}\psi^*\psi\mathbf{A}
$$

The order parameter current density field strength field is used to define the order parameter current density field strength field strength, which is a function of position and time. The order parameter current density field strength field strength is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\nabla\psi^*\psi - \frac{e}{mc}\psi^*\psi\mathbf{A}
$$

The order parameter current density field strength field strength is used to define the order parameter current density field strength field strength field, which is a function of position and time. The order parameter current density field strength field strength field is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\hbar}{2mi}\nabla\psi^*\psi - \frac{e}{mc}\psi^*\psi\mathbf{A}
$$

The order parameter current density field strength field strength field is used to define the order parameter current density field strength field strength field strength, which is a function of position and time.

### Subsection: 4.4d Applications of Ginzburg-Landau Theory in Condensed Matter Physics

The Ginzburg-Landau theory has been widely applied in condensed matter physics to study phase transitions and critical phenomena. It has been used to describe the behavior of superconductors, superfluids, and other systems with long-range order. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of the Ginzburg-Landau theory in condensed matter physics.

#### Superconductivity

The Ginzburg-Landau theory has been instrumental in the study of superconductivity. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature, where the superconducting state is expected to be unstable. The theory describes the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in terms of an order parameter, which is a complex-valued function that describes the state of the system.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory has been used to derive the Landau-Ginzburg equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. These equations have been used to study the properties of superconductors, such as the critical temperature, the energy gap, and the behavior of the order parameter.

#### Superfluidity

The Ginzburg-Landau theory has also been applied to the study of superfluidity. Superfluidity is a state of matter in which the particles move without friction, and the Ginzburg-Landau theory provides a mathematical description of this phenomenon. The theory has been used to study the behavior of superfluids near the critical temperature, where the superfluid state is expected to be unstable.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory has been used to derive the Landau-Ginzburg equations for superfluids, which describe the behavior of superfluids near the critical temperature. These equations have been used to study the properties of superfluids, such as the critical temperature, the energy gap, and the behavior of the order parameter.

#### Other Applications

The Ginzburg-Landau theory has been applied to a wide range of other systems in condensed matter physics, including ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and liquid crystals. In each of these systems, the Ginzburg-Landau theory provides a mathematical description of the phase transition and critical phenomena.

In ferromagnets, the Ginzburg-Landau theory has been used to study the behavior of the magnetization near the critical temperature, where the ferromagnetic state is expected to be unstable. In antiferromagnets, the theory has been used to study the behavior of the antiferromagnetic order parameter near the critical temperature. In liquid crystals, the theory has been used to study the behavior of the director near the critical temperature, where the liquid crystal state is expected to be unstable.

In conclusion, the Ginzburg-Landau theory has been a powerful tool in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Its applications have extended beyond the original context of superconductivity and superfluidity, and it continues to be a fundamental concept in the field of condensed matter physics.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the realm of Mean Field Theory, a fundamental concept in the study of many-body systems. We have explored its origins, its assumptions, and its applications in condensed matter physics.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Hartree-Fock Theory

### Introduction

The Hartree-Fock theory, named after the physicists Dirk C. Hartree and Vladimir Fock, is a mean-field theory used in quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics. It is a fundamental concept in the field of many-body theory, providing a simplified yet powerful framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of the Hartree-Fock theory, its assumptions, and its applications in condensed matter systems.

The Hartree-Fock theory is based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes that the particles in the system are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles, rather than the individual interactions between particles. This allows us to derive a set of coupled integro-differential equations that describe the behavior of the system. These equations are known as the Hartree-Fock equations.

The Hartree-Fock theory has been widely used in condensed matter physics to study systems such as metals, insulators, and quantum gases. It has also found applications in nuclear physics, where it is used to describe the behavior of nucleons in a nucleus. Despite its simplicity, the Hartree-Fock theory has been instrumental in providing insights into the behavior of many-body systems.

In this chapter, we will start by introducing the basic concepts of the Hartree-Fock theory, including the Hartree-Fock equations and the mean-field approximation. We will then discuss the physical interpretation of these concepts and their implications for the behavior of the system. We will also explore some of the applications of the Hartree-Fock theory in condensed matter systems, including its use in studying phase transitions and the electronic structure of materials.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the Hartree-Fock theory and its role in many-body theory. You should also be able to apply the concepts learned to understand and analyze the behavior of condensed matter systems.




### Conclusion

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of condensed matter physics, including the behavior of electrons in materials and the role of interactions between them. We have also discussed the concept of many-body systems, where the behavior of a system is determined by the interactions between all its constituent particles. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the study of strongly correlated systems, which are a class of many-body systems where the interactions between particles are particularly strong.

Strongly correlated systems are of great interest in condensed matter physics due to their unique properties and behaviors. They are often characterized by phenomena such as metal-insulator transitions, high-temperature superconductivity, and quantum phase transitions. These systems are also of great importance in materials science, as they can exhibit properties that are not found in non-interacting systems.

In this chapter, we will explore the theoretical framework of many-body theory, which provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of strongly correlated systems. We will also discuss various computational techniques, such as density functional theory and perturbation theory, that are used to study these systems. Finally, we will examine some of the most important examples of strongly correlated systems, including metals, insulators, and quantum magnets.

The study of strongly correlated systems is a vast and complex field, with many open questions and ongoing research. However, by understanding the fundamental concepts and techniques presented in this chapter, readers will be well-equipped to explore this exciting area of condensed matter physics. So, let us embark on this journey together, and explore the fascinating world of strongly correlated systems.




### Subsection: 5.1a Hubbard Hamiltonian and Its Physical Interpretation

The Hubbard Hamiltonian is a mathematical representation of the Hubbard model, a theoretical model used to describe the behavior of strongly correlated systems. It is a one-band model that describes the on-site interaction between electrons of opposite spin by a single parameter, denoted as $U$. The Hubbard Hamiltonian may take the following form:

$$
H = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} (c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{j,\sigma} + h.c.) + U \sum_{i} n_{i,\uparrow}n_{i,\downarrow}
$$

where $c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger}$ and $c_{i,\sigma}$ denote the creation and annihilation operators of an electron of spin $\sigma$ on a localized orbital at site $i$, and $n_{i,\sigma} = c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{i,\sigma}$ is the number operator. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the electrons, while the second term represents the on-site Coulomb interaction. The parameter $t$ is the hopping integral, which describes the probability of an electron hopping from one site to another.

The Hubbard Hamiltonian is a simplified model that captures the essential features of strongly correlated systems. It is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of systems with localized electrons, such as transition metal oxides and quantum dots. The model is based on several assumptions, including the following:

1. The electrons are localized on a lattice, and their motion is restricted to nearest-neighbor sites.
2. The electrons are spin-1/2 particles.
3. The on-site Coulomb interaction is the only significant interaction between electrons.
4. The electrons are non-interacting when they are on different sites.

These assumptions allow us to derive the Hubbard Hamiltonian, which is a simplified version of the more general Hamiltonian for a system of interacting electrons. The Hubbard Hamiltonian is particularly useful for studying systems with strong correlations, where the interactions between electrons are significant compared to the kinetic energy.

The physical interpretation of the Hubbard Hamiltonian is that it describes the behavior of a system of interacting electrons on a lattice. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the electrons, which is proportional to the hopping integral $t$. The second term represents the on-site Coulomb interaction, which is proportional to the product of the number operators for electrons of opposite spin. This term accounts for the repulsion between electrons of opposite spin, which is a key feature of strongly correlated systems.

The Hubbard Hamiltonian is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of strongly correlated systems. It has been used to study a wide range of systems, including metals, insulators, and quantum magnets. In the next section, we will explore the physical implications of the Hubbard Hamiltonian and its role in the study of strongly correlated systems.





### Subsection: 5.1b Mean Field Approximation for Hubbard Model

The Hubbard model is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of strongly correlated systems, but it is often intractable due to the complexity of the interactions between electrons. To simplify the problem, we can use the mean field approximation, which is a powerful tool for dealing with systems of interacting particles.

The mean field approximation is based on the following assumptions:

1. The particles are non-interacting.
2. The particles are influenced by an average field created by all the other particles.

These assumptions allow us to decouple the interactions between particles and treat them as independent entities. This is particularly useful for systems with a large number of particles, where the interactions between particles become too complex to handle analytically.

In the context of the Hubbard model, the mean field approximation can be applied by replacing the on-site Coulomb interaction term with a mean field term. This results in the following mean field Hubbard Hamiltonian:

$$
H_{\text{MF}} = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma} (c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{j,\sigma} + h.c.) + U \sum_{i} n_{i,\uparrow}n_{i,\downarrow} - \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i} n_{i}
$$

where $n_{i} = n_{i,\uparrow} + n_{i,\downarrow}$ is the total number of electrons at site $i$.

The mean field Hubbard Hamiltonian can be solved using standard techniques, such as perturbation theory or mean field theory. This allows us to obtain analytical results for the properties of the system, such as the ground state energy and the electronic band structure.

However, it is important to note that the mean field approximation is only valid when the interactions between particles are weak compared to the kinetic energy of the particles. In strongly correlated systems, where the interactions between particles are strong, the mean field approximation may not be valid. In these cases, more sophisticated methods, such as density functional theory or dynamical mean field theory, may be required to accurately describe the behavior of the system.




### Subsection: 5.1c Numerical Methods for Hubbard Model

The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is a challenging system to solve analytically due to the complexity of the interactions between particles. This has led to the development of various numerical methods to study the properties of the Hubbard model. These methods are particularly useful for systems with a large number of particles, where the interactions between particles become too complex to handle analytically.

One such method is the Lanczos algorithm, which can produce static and dynamic properties of the system. Ground state calculations using this method require the storage of three vectors of the size of the number of states. The number of states scales exponentially with the size of the system, which limits the number of sites in the lattice to about 20 on 21st century hardware.

Another method is the projector and finite-temperature auxiliary-field Monte Carlo, which can obtain certain properties of the system. However, for low temperatures, convergence problems appear that lead to an exponential computational effort with decreasing temperature due to the so-called fermion sign problem.

The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method is another powerful tool for studying the Hubbard model. This method is particularly useful for systems with one-dimensional geometry, where it can handle systems with a large number of particles. The DMRG method is based on the concept of renormalization, where the system is divided into smaller blocks, and the interactions between these blocks are treated approximately. This allows for the efficient computation of the ground state energy and other properties of the system.

In addition to these methods, there are also various perturbative techniques that can be used to study the Hubbard model. These include perturbation theory and mean field theory, which can be used to approximate the behavior of the system when the interactions between particles are weak compared to the kinetic energy of the particles.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these numerical methods to the study of the Hubbard model in various systems, including one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional lattices, and systems with different types of interactions between particles.




### Subsection: 5.1d Applications of the Hubbard Model in Condensed Matter Physics

The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, has been instrumental in understanding a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter physics. Its applications extend from one-dimensional systems of hydrogen atoms to more complex systems with competing effects.

#### 5.1d.1 Mott-Hubbard Insulators

The Hubbard model can be used to describe Mott-Hubbard insulators, which are a type of insulator where the electrons are localized due to strong interactions between them. This can be seen as analogous to the Hubbard model for hydrogen chains, where conduction between unit cells can be described by a transfer integral.

In a Mott-Hubbard insulator, the electrons are localized within a unit cell, and the system exhibits a metal-insulator transition as the interaction strength is varied. This transition is characterized by a change in the ground state from a metal (where the electrons are delocalized) to an insulator (where the electrons are localized).

#### 5.1d.2 Charge-Transfer Insulators

On the other hand, the Hubbard model can also describe charge-transfer insulators, where the electrons exhibit another kind of behavior. In these systems, the electrons are not localized within a unit cell, but instead, they exhibit charge transfer between unit cells. This results in a different type of insulator, known as a charge-transfer insulator.

The Hubbard model can be used to study these systems, but it is important to note that more complex systems may experience other effects that the model does not consider. For example, in ionic systems, the electrons may exhibit both Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer behavior, leading to a competition between these effects.

#### 5.1d.3 Numerical Treatment of the Hubbard Model

The fact that the Hubbard model has not been solved analytically in arbitrary dimensions has led to intense research into numerical methods for these strongly correlated electron systems. One major goal of this research is to determine the low-temperature phase diagram of this model, particularly in two-dimensions.

Approximate numerical treatment of the Hubbard model on finite systems is possible via various methods. One such method, the Lanczos algorithm, can produce static and dynamic properties of the system. Ground state calculations using this method require the storage of three vectors of the size of the number of states. The number of states scales exponentially with the size of the system, which limits the number of sites in the lattice to about 20 on 21st century hardware.

Another method, the projector and finite-temperature auxiliary-field Monte Carlo, can obtain certain properties of the system. However, for low temperatures, convergence problems appear that lead to an exponential computational effort with decreasing temperature due to the so-called fermion sign problem.

In conclusion, the Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, has been instrumental in understanding a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter physics. Its applications extend from one-dimensional systems of hydrogen atoms to more complex systems with competing effects. However, the complexity of these systems often requires the use of numerical methods to study them.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Metal-Insulator Transition

### Introduction

The metal-insulator transition is a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics, representing a phase transition between a metallic and an insulating state. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of this transition, exploring its theoretical underpinnings, experimental manifestations, and the many-body theory that provides a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon.

The metal-insulator transition is a critical point in the evolution of a material's electronic properties. It marks the transition from a state where electrons are delocalized and can move freely (metallic state) to a state where electrons are localized and cannot move freely (insulating state). This transition is governed by the interplay of various factors, including the strength of electron-electron interactions, the band structure of the material, and the temperature.

The many-body theory, with its mathematical complexity and physical depth, provides a powerful framework for understanding the metal-insulator transition. This theory takes into account the interactions between all the electrons in a system, leading to a rich variety of phenomena that can only be understood in terms of these interactions. The theory is expressed in terms of equations that describe the behavior of the system, such as the Hubbard model and the Hartree-Fock approximation.

In this chapter, we will explore the metal-insulator transition from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. We will delve into the mathematical formulations of the many-body theory, and discuss how these theories can be used to understand the experimental observations of the metal-insulator transition. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions in this field.

The metal-insulator transition is a fascinating and complex phenomenon, with implications for a wide range of materials and applications. By understanding this transition, we can gain insights into the behavior of a wide range of materials, and develop new materials with desired electronic properties. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to this topic, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools to explore this fascinating field further.




### Subsection: 5.2a Mott Insulator and Its Physical Properties

The Mott insulator, named after the British physicist Nevill Francis Mott, is a type of insulator that arises due to strong electron correlations. In a Mott insulator, the electrons are localized within a unit cell, and the system exhibits a metal-insulator transition as the interaction strength is varied. This transition is characterized by a change in the ground state from a metal (where the electrons are delocalized) to an insulator (where the electrons are localized).

#### 5.2a.1 Electronic Structure of Mott Insulators

The electronic structure of Mott insulators is characterized by a gap in the electronic band structure, known as the Mott gap. This gap is a direct consequence of the strong electron correlations in the system. The Mott gap is typically larger than the bandwidth of the system, indicating that the electrons are localized within a unit cell.

The Mott gap can be understood in terms of the Hubbard model, which describes the system of interacting electrons on a lattice. In the limit of large interaction strength, the Hubbard model reduces to the Mott insulator. The Mott gap then corresponds to the energy difference between the lower and upper Hubbard bands.

#### 5.2a.2 Magnetic Properties of Mott Insulators

Mott insulators are also known for their interesting magnetic properties. Due to the localization of electrons, Mott insulators exhibit a variety of magnetic ground states, including antiferromagnetism, ferromagnetism, and spin liquid states.

The magnetic properties of Mott insulators can be understood in terms of the exchange interaction. In a Mott insulator, the exchange interaction is dominated by the superexchange, which arises from the hopping of a "d" electron from one transition metal site to another and then back the same way. This process results in an antiferromagnetic exchange, which is responsible for the antiferromagnetic ground state in many Mott insulators.

#### 5.2a.3 Mott Insulators in Condensed Matter Physics

Mott insulators have been extensively studied in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic and magnetic properties. They have been observed in a variety of systems, including transition metal oxides, rare earth compounds, and organic materials.

The study of Mott insulators has been instrumental in the development of many-body theory, providing a concrete example of a system where the mean-field approximation fails due to strong electron correlations. The study of Mott insulators continues to be an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to understand their properties and to develop new methods for their analysis.




### Subsection: 5.2b Mott-Hubbard Transition

The Mott-Hubbard transition is a critical phenomenon that occurs in strongly correlated systems, particularly in Mott insulators. It is a first-order phase transition that marks the boundary between the Mott insulating phase and the Hubbard metal phase.

#### 5.2b.1 Definition of Mott-Hubbard Transition

The Mott-Hubbard transition is a quantum phase transition that occurs in systems with strong electron correlations. It is characterized by a sudden change in the ground state of the system as the interaction strength is varied. At low interaction strengths, the system is in the Hubbard metal phase, where the electrons are delocalized and the system is metallic. As the interaction strength is increased, the system undergoes a phase transition into the Mott insulating phase, where the electrons are localized and the system is insulating.

The Mott-Hubbard transition can be understood in terms of the Hubbard model. In the limit of large interaction strength, the Hubbard model reduces to the Mott insulator. The transition occurs when the interaction energy becomes comparable to the bandwidth of the system, leading to the localization of electrons.

#### 5.2b.2 Properties of Mott-Hubbard Transition

The Mott-Hubbard transition is a first-order phase transition, meaning that there is a discontinuity in the ground state properties across the transition. This is in contrast to a second-order phase transition, where the ground state properties change continuously. The discontinuity in the ground state properties across the Mott-Hubbard transition is a key feature that distinguishes it from other phase transitions.

The Mott-Hubbard transition is also characterized by a change in the electronic structure of the system. In the Hubbard metal phase, the electrons are delocalized and the system exhibits a continuous density of states. In the Mott insulating phase, the electrons are localized and the system exhibits a discrete density of states. This change in the electronic structure across the transition is a direct consequence of the localization of electrons.

#### 5.2b.3 Mott-Hubbard Transition in Condensed Matter Systems

The Mott-Hubbard transition has been observed in a variety of condensed matter systems, including transition metal oxides, heavy fermion systems, and high-temperature superconductors. In these systems, the transition is often accompanied by a change in the magnetic properties of the system. For example, in transition metal oxides, the transition is often accompanied by a change from a paramagnetic metal to an antiferromagnetic insulator.

The Mott-Hubbard transition is a fundamental concept in the study of strongly correlated systems. It provides a framework for understanding the behavior of these systems near the metal-insulator transition and has important implications for a wide range of physical properties, including the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and transport properties of these systems.




### Subsection: 5.2c Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Mott Insulators

The Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems, particularly Mott insulators. It provides a non-perturbative treatment of local interactions between electrons, bridging the gap between the nearly free electron gas limit and the atomic limit of condensed-matter physics.

#### 5.2c.1 Definition of Dynamical Mean Field Theory

The DMFT is a method to determine the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials. It consists in mapping a many-body lattice problem to a many-body "local" problem, called an impurity model. While the lattice problem is in general intractable, the impurity model is usually solvable through various schemes. The mapping in itself does not constitute an approximation. The only approximation made in ordinary DMFT schemes is to assume the lattice self-energy to be a momentum-independent (local) quantity. This approximation becomes exact in the limit of lattices with an infinite coordination.

The DMFT is particularly useful for studying Mott insulators, as it allows us to describe the phase transition between a metal and a Mott insulator when the strength of electronic correlations is increased. It has been successfully applied to real materials, in combination with the local density approximation of density functional theory.

#### 5.2c.2 Extensions of DMFT

DMFT has several extensions, extending the above formalism to multi-orbital, multi-site problems, long-range correlations and non-equilibrium.

##### Multi-orbital Extension

The DMFT can be extended to Hubbard models with multiple orbitals, namely with electron-electron interactions of the form $U_{\alpha \beta} n_{\alpha}n_{\beta}$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ denote different orbitals. The combination with density functional theory (DFT+DMFT) then allows for a realistic calculation of correlated materials.

##### Extended DMFT

Extended DMFT yields a local impurity self energy for non-equilibrium systems. This extension is particularly useful for studying dynamical properties of Mott insulators, such as the optical conductivity and the dynamical structure factor.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of DMFT to Mott insulators, discussing specific examples and their properties.




### Subsection: 5.2d Applications of Mott Insulators in Condensed Matter Physics

Mott insulators, due to their unique electronic structure, have found numerous applications in condensed matter physics. These applications range from understanding the behavior of real materials to providing a platform for studying fundamental quantum phenomena.

#### 5.2d.1 Mott Insulators in Real Materials

Mott insulators are found in a variety of real materials, including transition metal oxides, rare-earth compounds, and even some organic systems. The study of these materials has been instrumental in understanding the behavior of Mott insulators. For instance, the Mott insulator state in the compound VO2 has been extensively studied due to its unique properties.

VO2 is a material that undergoes a metal-insulator transition at a critical temperature. Above this temperature, VO2 behaves as a metal, with delocalized electrons. However, below this temperature, it becomes an insulator, with localized electrons. This behavior is a direct consequence of the Mott insulator state. The study of VO2 and other similar materials has provided valuable insights into the behavior of Mott insulators.

#### 5.2d.2 Mott Insulators in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, Mott insulators are used as a platform for studying fundamental quantum phenomena. For instance, the Hubbard model, a mathematical model that describes the behavior of Mott insulators, has been used to study phase transitions, quantum entanglement, and other quantum phenomena.

The Hubbard model is defined by the Hamiltonian:

$$
H = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} (c_i^\dagger c_j + h.c.) + U \sum_i n_i(n_i-1)
$$

where $c_i^\dagger$ and $c_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron at site $i$, $t$ is the hopping energy, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb repulsion, and $n_i$ is the number operator. The first term represents the kinetic energy of the electrons, while the second term represents the Coulomb repulsion.

The Hubbard model has been used to study a variety of quantum phenomena. For instance, it has been used to study the metal-insulator transition, where the system transitions from a state with delocalized electrons (a metal) to a state with localized electrons (an insulator). This transition is driven by the Coulomb repulsion term in the Hubbard model.

The Hubbard model has also been used to study quantum entanglement. In the limit of large $U$, the ground state of the Hubbard model is a product state, with no entanglement between different sites. However, as $U$ is decreased, the ground state becomes more entangled. This provides a platform for studying the effects of entanglement on the behavior of a many-body system.

In conclusion, Mott insulators, due to their unique electronic structure, have found numerous applications in condensed matter physics. From understanding the behavior of real materials to studying fundamental quantum phenomena, Mott insulators continue to be a rich area of research.




### Subsection: 5.3a Anderson Localization and Its Physical Interpretation

Anderson localization is a phenomenon that occurs in disordered systems, where the wave function of a particle becomes localized due to the interference of multiple scattering events. This localization is a direct consequence of the wave nature of particles and the disorder in the system.

#### 5.3a.1 Physical Interpretation of Anderson Localization

The physical interpretation of Anderson localization is rooted in the wave nature of particles. In a disordered system, the wave function of a particle experiences multiple scattering events, each of which alters the direction of the wave. The interference of these scattered waves can lead to constructive or destructive interference, depending on the phase of the waves.

In the case of Anderson localization, the interference leads to a cancellation of the wave function in all directions except for a few, where the phase of the waves is such that constructive interference occurs. This results in the wave function becoming localized in these directions.

The localization length, denoted by $\xi$, is a measure of the extent of this localization. It is defined as the distance over which the wave function retains a significant amplitude. The localization length is inversely proportional to the disorder in the system, with a longer localization length indicating a less disordered system.

#### 5.3a.2 Experimental Evidence of Anderson Localization

Anderson localization has been observed in a variety of systems, including light propagating through a disordered medium, elastic waves in a 3D disordered medium, and atomic matter waves in a 3D model.

In the case of light, Anderson localization has been observed in a 2D lattice (Schwartz "et al.", 2007) and a 1D lattice (Lahini "et al.", 2006). This localization has also been demonstrated in an optical fiber medium (Karbasi "et al.", 2012) and a biological medium (Choi "et al.", 2018). The localization of a Bose–Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered optical potential has also been reported (Billy "et al.", 2008; Roati "et al.", 2008).

In 3D, observations are more rare. Anderson localization of elastic waves in a 3D disordered medium has been reported (Hu "et al.", 2008). The existence of Anderson localization for light in 3D was debated for years (Skipetrov "et al.", 2016) and remains unresolved today. Recent experiments (Naraghi "et al.", 2016; Cobus " et al.", 2023) support theoretical predictions that the vector nature of light prohibits the transition to Anderson localization.

#### 5.3a.3 Anderson Localization and the Many-Body Problem

The many-body problem is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics, where the behavior of a system of interacting particles is described by a many-body Hamiltonian. The Anderson localization phenomenon is particularly relevant to the many-body problem, as it can lead to the localization of the wave function of the particles, which can have significant implications for the behavior of the system.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of Anderson localization for the many-body problem.




### Subsection: 5.3b Localization-Delocalization Transition

The localization-delocalization transition is a critical phenomenon that occurs in disordered systems, such as Anderson localization. This transition is characterized by a change in the behavior of the wave function of a particle, from being localized to being delocalized.

#### 5.3b.1 Definition of Localization-Delocalization Transition

The localization-delocalization transition is a phase transition that occurs in disordered systems. It is characterized by a change in the behavior of the wave function of a particle, from being localized to being delocalized. This transition is typically observed in systems with a high degree of disorder, where the wave function of a particle experiences multiple scattering events.

The localization-delocalization transition can be understood in terms of the localization length, $\xi$. As the disorder in the system increases, the localization length decreases. When the localization length becomes smaller than the system size, the wave function of the particle becomes delocalized. This is because the wave function is no longer localized in a few directions, but is spread out over the entire system.

#### 5.3b.2 Physical Interpretation of Localization-Delocalization Transition

The physical interpretation of the localization-delocalization transition is rooted in the wave nature of particles. In a disordered system, the wave function of a particle experiences multiple scattering events, each of which alters the direction of the wave. The interference of these scattered waves can lead to constructive or destructive interference, depending on the phase of the waves.

In the case of the localization-delocalization transition, the interference leads to a cancellation of the wave function in all directions, resulting in a delocalized wave function. This transition is typically observed in systems with a high degree of disorder, where the wave function of a particle experiences multiple scattering events.

#### 5.3b.3 Experimental Evidence of Localization-Delocalization Transition

The localization-delocalization transition has been observed in a variety of systems, including light propagating through a disordered medium, elastic waves in a 3D disordered medium, and atomic matter waves in a 3D model.

In the case of light, the localization-delocalization transition has been observed in a 2D lattice (Schwartz "et al.", 2007) and a 1D lattice (Lahini "et al.", 2006). This transition has also been demonstrated in an optical fiber medium (Karbasi "et al.", 2012) and a biological medium (Choi "et al.", 2018). The localization-delocalization transition of light has also been observed in a 3D disordered medium (John "et al.", 2010).

In the case of elastic waves, the localization-delocalization transition has been observed in a 3D disordered medium (Zhang "et al.", 2011). This transition has also been demonstrated in a 3D model of atomic matter waves (Billy "et al.", 2008).

The localization-delocalization transition is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of disordered systems. It provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of waves in disordered media, and has important implications for a wide range of fields, from optics to materials science.




### Subsection: 5.3c Diagrammatic Techniques for Anderson Localization

In the previous section, we discussed the localization-delocalization transition in Anderson localization. In this section, we will explore the use of diagrammatic techniques to understand and analyze this transition.

#### 5.3c.1 Diagrammatic Representation of Anderson Localization

The diagrammatic representation of Anderson localization is based on the concept of a wave function, which is a mathematical function that describes the state of a particle. In the context of Anderson localization, the wave function of a particle is represented by a line, with the length of the line representing the amplitude of the wave function.

The disorder in the system is represented by random points along the line, which correspond to the scattering events experienced by the particle. The interference of the waves is represented by the overlap of the lines, with constructive interference resulting in a longer line and destructive interference resulting in a shorter line.

#### 5.3c.2 Diagrammatic Analysis of Localization-Delocalization Transition

The diagrammatic analysis of the localization-delocalization transition involves examining the changes in the wave function as the disorder in the system increases. As the disorder increases, the length of the wave function decreases, indicating a transition from a delocalized to a localized state.

The critical point at which this transition occurs is determined by the balance between constructive and destructive interference. When the interference is constructive, the wave function is delocalized, and when it is destructive, the wave function is localized.

#### 5.3c.3 Physical Interpretation of Diagrammatic Techniques

The physical interpretation of the diagrammatic techniques is rooted in the wave nature of particles. The lines represent the wave function of the particle, and the random points along the lines represent the scattering events experienced by the particle. The overlap of the lines represents the interference of the waves, with constructive interference resulting in a longer line and destructive interference resulting in a shorter line.

The localization-delocalization transition is represented by the length of the lines. When the lines are long, the particle is delocalized, and when they are short, the particle is localized. This interpretation provides a visual representation of the wave function and the interference of waves, making it a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing Anderson localization.

In the next section, we will explore the application of these diagrammatic techniques to specific examples of Anderson localization.




### Subsection: 5.3d Applications of Anderson Localization in Condensed Matter Physics

Anderson localization is a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics, with wide-ranging applications in various fields. In this section, we will explore some of these applications, focusing on the use of Anderson localization in the study of quantum systems.

#### 5.3d.1 Anderson Localization in Quantum Systems

Quantum systems, such as quantum dots and quantum wires, are systems in which quantum effects play a significant role. In these systems, the wave function of a particle can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, leading to phenomena such as wave-particle duality and quantum confinement.

Anderson localization is particularly relevant in these systems, as it provides a way to understand the localization of particles in the presence of disorder. This is particularly important in quantum systems, where the wave function of a particle can be significantly affected by small changes in the system.

#### 5.3d.2 Anderson Localization in Quantum Dots

Quantum dots are small particles, typically on the order of a few nanometers in size, that exhibit quantum effects. These dots can be made from a variety of materials, including semiconductors, metals, and even molecules.

In quantum dots, Anderson localization can lead to the formation of discrete energy levels, known as quantum states. These states are localized within the dot and are separated by energy gaps. This localization can be used to control the properties of the dot, such as its optical and electronic properties.

#### 5.3d.3 Anderson Localization in Quantum Wires

Quantum wires are one-dimensional structures, typically on the order of a few nanometers in width, that exhibit quantum effects. These wires can be made from a variety of materials, including semiconductors and carbon nanotubes.

In quantum wires, Anderson localization can lead to the formation of one-dimensional localized states. These states can be used to control the flow of particles along the wire, leading to phenomena such as quantum confinement and quantum transport.

#### 5.3d.4 Anderson Localization in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, Anderson localization is used to understand a variety of phenomena, including the behavior of electrons in disordered materials and the formation of localized states in the presence of disorder.

For example, in the study of metals, Anderson localization can be used to understand the metal-insulator transition, a phenomenon in which a metal transitions into an insulator due to the presence of disorder. This transition is a direct consequence of the localization of electrons in the presence of disorder, as predicted by Anderson's theorem.

In conclusion, Anderson localization is a powerful tool in the study of quantum systems and condensed matter physics. Its applications range from the study of quantum dots and quantum wires to the understanding of metal-insulator transitions in disordered materials.




### Subsection: 5.4a Kondo Effect and Its Physical Properties

The Kondo effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs in systems with interacting electrons. It is named after the Japanese physicist Jun Kondo, who first proposed the theory in 1964. The Kondo effect is a manifestation of the many-body problem in condensed matter physics, where the interactions between a large number of particles lead to emergent phenomena that cannot be predicted by considering the particles individually.

#### 5.4a.1 The Kondo Effect in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter systems, the Kondo effect is observed in materials with a heavy fermion character. These materials are typically intermetallic compounds, such as cerium, praseodymium, and ytterbium, and actinide elements such as uranium. The Kondo effect is responsible for the formation of heavy fermions and Kondo insulators in these materials.

The Kondo effect is characterized by a non-perturbative growth of the interaction between electrons. This leads to the formation of quasi-electrons with masses up to thousands of times the free electron mass. This phenomenon is known as the Kondo effect. The Kondo effect is also responsible for the formation of Kondo insulators, which are materials that exhibit insulating behavior due to the Kondo effect.

#### 5.4a.2 The Kondo Effect in Quantum Dot Systems

The Kondo effect is also observed in quantum dot systems. A quantum dot is a small particle, typically on the order of a few nanometers in size, that exhibits quantum effects. In these systems, the Kondo effect is observed when the dot is coupled to a metallic conduction band. The conduction electrons can scatter off the dot, leading to the formation of a Kondo resonance. This resonance is a manifestation of the Kondo effect and is characterized by a sharp peak in the density of states at the Fermi level.

#### 5.4a.3 The Kondo Effect in Quantum Systems

In quantum systems, the Kondo effect can lead to the formation of new quantum states. For example, in 2017, teams from the Vienna University of Technology and Rice University conducted experiments into the development of new materials made from the metals cerium, bismuth, and palladium in specific combinations. These experiments led to the discovery of a new quantum state, a correlation-driven Weyl semimetal. This state is characterized by the presence of Weyl points, which are points in the band structure where the electron density of states changes sign. The discovery of this state was made possible by the understanding of the Kondo effect and its role in the formation of new quantum states.

In conclusion, the Kondo effect is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics. It is responsible for the formation of heavy fermions and Kondo insulators, and it plays a crucial role in the behavior of quantum systems. The study of the Kondo effect continues to be an active area of research, with new discoveries and applications being made on a regular basis.




### Subsection: 5.4b Anderson Model for Kondo Effect

The Anderson model, named after Philip Warren Anderson, is a Hamiltonian that is used to describe magnetic impurities embedded in metals. It is often applied to the description of Kondo effect-type problems, such as heavy fermion systems and Kondo insulators. The model is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of the Kondo effect in quantum dot systems.

#### 5.4b.1 The Anderson Model

The Anderson model is defined by the Hamiltonian

$$
H = \sum_{\sigma}\epsilon_{\sigma} d^{\dagger}_{\sigma}d_{\sigma} 
+ \sum_{k,\sigma}V_k(d^{\dagger}_{\sigma}c_{k\sigma} + c^{\dagger}_{k\sigma}d_{\sigma}),
$$

where the $c$ operator is the annihilation operator of a conduction electron, and $d$ is the annihilation operator for the impurity. The on–site Coulomb repulsion is $U$, and $V$ gives the hybridization.

#### 5.4b.2 The Anderson Model and the Kondo Effect

The Anderson model is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of the Kondo effect in quantum dot systems. In these systems, the Kondo effect is observed when the dot is coupled to a metallic conduction band. The conduction electrons can scatter off the dot, leading to the formation of a Kondo resonance. This resonance is a manifestation of the Kondo effect and is characterized by a sharp peak in the density of states at the Fermi level.

The Anderson model provides a mathematical framework for understanding this behavior. The model yields several regimes that depend on the relationship of the impurity energy levels to the Fermi level $E_{\rm F}$. In the local moment regime, the magnetic moment is present at the impurity site. However, for low enough temperature, the moment is Kondo screened to give non-magnetic many-body singlet state.

#### 5.4b.3 The Anderson Model and Heavy-Fermion Systems

For heavy-fermion systems, a lattice of impurities is described by the periodic Anderson model. The one-dimensional model is

$$
H = \sum_{j,\sigma}\epsilon_f f^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}f_{j\sigma} 
+ \sum_{j,k,\sigma}V_{jk}(e^{ikx_j}f^{\dagger}_{j\sigma}c_{k\sigma} + e^{-ikx_j}c^{\dagger}_{k\sigma}f_{j\sigma}),
$$

where $x_j$ is the position of impurity site $j$, and $f$ is the impurity creation operator (used instead of $d$ by convention for heavy-fermion systems). The periodic Anderson model is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of heavy fermion systems, which exhibit a range of interesting properties due to the Kondo effect.




### Subsection: 5.4c Renormalization Group Approach to Kondo Effect

The Renormalization Group (RG) approach is a powerful mathematical technique used to study the behavior of quantum systems near a critical point. It allows us to systematically account for the effects of interactions between particles, and to understand how these interactions change as we vary the energy scale of the system. In the context of the Kondo effect, the RG approach provides a way to understand the emergence of the Kondo resonance and the screening of the impurity spin.

#### 5.4c.1 The Renormalization Group Approach to the Kondo Effect

The RG approach to the Kondo effect begins by considering the Kondo model, which describes a single magnetic impurity coupled to a non-interacting conduction band. The Hamiltonian of the Kondo model is given by

$$
H = \sum_{k,\sigma} \epsilon_k c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{k,\sigma} + J \vec{S} \cdot \vec{s},
$$

where $c_{k,\sigma}^{\dagger}$ and $c_{k,\sigma}$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a conduction electron with momentum $k$ and spin $\sigma$, $\epsilon_k$ is the energy of the conduction electron, $J$ is the coupling constant between the impurity spin $\vec{S}$ and the conduction electron spin $\vec{s}$, and $\cdot$ denotes the dot product.

The RG approach to the Kondo model involves integrating out the conduction electrons at high energy scales, and then iteratively reducing the energy scale until we reach the scale of the Kondo resonance. At each step, we renormalize the coupling constant $J$ and the impurity spin $\vec{S}$, taking into account the effects of the interactions between the impurity and the conduction electrons.

#### 5.4c.2 The Renormalization Group Flow and the Kondo Effect

The RG approach to the Kondo effect leads to a renormalization group flow, which describes how the coupling constant $J$ and the impurity spin $\vec{S}$ change as we vary the energy scale of the system. Near the critical point of the Kondo effect, the renormalization group flow leads to the emergence of the Kondo resonance, which is characterized by a sharp peak in the density of states at the Fermi level.

The renormalization group approach also provides a way to understand the screening of the impurity spin in the Kondo effect. As we integrate out the conduction electrons at high energy scales, the impurity spin becomes increasingly screened by the conduction electrons. This screening leads to the formation of the Kondo resonance, which is a manifestation of the Kondo effect.

#### 5.4c.3 The Renormalization Group Approach and Heavy-Fermion Systems

The renormalization group approach has been used to study a variety of heavy-fermion systems, which are materials that exhibit heavy effective masses and strong correlations between electrons. In these systems, the renormalization group approach has provided valuable insights into the behavior of the Kondo effect and the emergence of heavy fermions.

For example, in the periodic Anderson model, which describes a lattice of impurities coupled to a conduction band, the renormalization group approach has been used to study the behavior of the Kondo effect as a function of the impurity concentration and the energy scale of the system. This approach has led to a deeper understanding of the behavior of heavy-fermion systems near the critical point of the Kondo effect.




### Subsection: 5.4d Applications of Kondo Effect in Condensed Matter Physics

The Kondo effect, as we have seen, is a phenomenon that occurs in strongly correlated systems, particularly in the presence of magnetic impurities. It has been observed in a variety of systems, from quantum dots to heavy fermion materials, and has been a subject of intense study due to its implications for understanding the behavior of these systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the Kondo effect in condensed matter physics.

#### 5.4d.1 Heavy Fermion Materials

Heavy fermion materials are a class of materials that exhibit the Kondo effect. These materials are characterized by the presence of heavy fermions, which are electrons that are dramatically slowed down by interactions with other particles. The Kondo effect in these materials leads to the formation of quasi-electrons with masses up to thousands of times the free electron mass. This phenomenon has been observed in a number of intermetallic compounds, particularly those involving rare earth elements such as cerium, praseodymium, and ytterbium, and actinide elements such as uranium.

The Kondo effect in these materials has been found to be crucial for understanding their unusual metallic delta-phase, which is characterized by a sharp increase in the density of states near the Fermi level. This increase is believed to be a manifestation of the Kondo effect, where the interactions between the conduction electrons and the magnetic impurities lead to a broadening of the impurity states, resulting in a peak in the density of states.

#### 5.4d.2 Quantum Dot Systems

Quantum dot systems, which are small semiconductor structures that confine electrons to a small region, also exhibit the Kondo effect. In these systems, a quantum dot with at least one unpaired electron behaves as a magnetic impurity, and when the dot is coupled to a metallic conduction band, the conduction electrons can scatter off the dot. This is completely analogous to the more traditional case of a magnetic impurity in a metal.

The Kondo effect in quantum dot systems has been observed in a variety of experiments, and has been found to be crucial for understanding the behavior of these systems. For example, the Kondo effect has been found to play a key role in the formation of the Coulomb blockade, a phenomenon where the quantum dot is isolated from the rest of the system due to the repulsion between electrons.

#### 5.4d.3 Band-Structure Hybridization and Flat Band Topology in Kondo Insulators

The Kondo effect has also been observed in Kondo insulators, which are materials that exhibit a gap in their electronic band structure due to the Kondo effect. In these materials, the Kondo effect leads to a hybridization of the band structure, where the conduction band and the impurity states overlap, resulting in a flat band topology. This phenomenon has been observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments, and has been found to be crucial for understanding the behavior of these materials.

#### 5.4d.4 Topological Kondo Effect

In 2012, Beri and Cooper proposed a topological Kondo effect, where the Kondo effect is combined with the concept of Majorana fermions. This proposal has been found to be promising for the realization of topological quantum computation.

#### 5.4d.5 Correlation-Driven Weyl Semimetal

In 2017, teams from the Vienna University of Technology and Rice University conducted experiments into the development of new materials made from the metals cerium, bismuth, and palladium in specific combinations. These experiments led to the discovery of a new quantum material, a correlation-driven Weyl semimetal, which is a state of matter characterized by the presence of Weyl fermions. The Kondo effect is believed to play a crucial role in the formation of this state.

In conclusion, the Kondo effect has been found to have a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics, from heavy fermion materials to quantum dot systems. Its study continues to be a subject of intense interest due to its implications for understanding the behavior of these systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Landau Fermi Liquid Theory

### Introduction

In the realm of condensed matter physics, the Landau Fermi Liquid Theory holds a pivotal role. This chapter, Chapter 6, delves into the intricacies of this theory, providing a comprehensive introduction to its principles and applications. 

The Landau Fermi Liquid Theory, named after the Russian physicist Lev Landau, is a theoretical model that describes the behavior of a system of interacting fermions at low temperatures. It is a cornerstone in the study of condensed matter systems, particularly in the understanding of metals. 

The theory is based on the concept of quasiparticles, which are collective excitations of the system that behave as if they were individual particles. These quasiparticles are the fundamental building blocks of the theory, and their properties are determined by the interactions between the individual fermions. 

In this chapter, we will explore the key assumptions of the Landau Fermi Liquid Theory, including the assumption of quasiparticles and the Fermi-Dirac statistics. We will also delve into the mathematical formulation of the theory, including the Landau equations and the Landau parameters. 

Furthermore, we will discuss the applications of the Landau Fermi Liquid Theory in various condensed matter systems, including metals, superconductors, and quantum gases. We will also touch upon the limitations and criticisms of the theory, providing a balanced understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the Landau Fermi Liquid Theory, its principles, and its applications. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the many-body theory and its applications in condensed matter systems.




### Subsection: 5.5a Quantum Spin Liquids and Their Physical Properties

Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) are a fascinating class of materials that have been the subject of intense study due to their unique physical properties. They are characterized by the presence of entangled spin states, which can lead to a variety of interesting phenomena. In this section, we will explore the physical properties of QSLs, focusing on their ground state and anyonic excitations.

#### 5.5a.1 Ground State of Quantum Spin Liquids

The ground state of a QSL is a state of minimum energy, which is typically a many-body state. It is characterized by the presence of entangled spin states, which can lead to a variety of interesting phenomena. For example, in the strongly correlated quantum spin liquid (SCQSL), the ground state is a state of heavy fermions, where the electrons are dramatically slowed down by interactions with other particles. This leads to a peak in the density of states near the Fermi level, which is believed to be a manifestation of the Kondo effect.

#### 5.5a.2 Anyonic Excitations in Quantum Spin Liquids

In addition to their ground state, QSLs also exhibit a variety of interesting excitations. These excitations, known as anyons, are quantum mechanical particles that exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. They are a direct consequence of the entangled spin states in QSLs, and their existence has been confirmed through direct measurements.

The first direct measurement of a QSL of the toric code type was reported in December 2021. This was achieved by two teams: one exploring ground state and anyonic excitations on a quantum processor, and the other implementing a theoretical blueprint of atoms on a ruby lattice held with optical tweezers on a quantum simulator. This breakthrough has opened up new avenues for studying QSLs and their properties.

#### 5.5a.3 Experimental Signatures and Probes of Quantum Spin Liquids

Since there is no single experimental feature which identifies a material as a spin liquid, a variety of techniques have been developed to probe the properties of QSLs. These include neutron scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and optical spectroscopy, among others. Each of these techniques provides a different perspective on the properties of QSLs, and their combined use can provide a comprehensive understanding of these fascinating materials.

In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of QSLs, focusing on their potential use in data storage and memory, as well as their role in topological quantum computation.




### Subsection: 5.5b Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model

The Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model is a quantum mechanical model that describes the behavior of spins in a system. It is a fundamental model in the study of quantum spin liquids and has been extensively studied due to its simplicity and relevance to real-world systems.

#### 5.5b.1 Definition and Properties of the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model

The Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model is a quantum mechanical model that describes the behavior of spins in a system. It is defined by the Hamiltonian operator, which is given by:

$$
H = \sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j
$$

where $J_{ij}$ is the exchange interaction between spins $i$ and $j$, and $\vec{S}_i$ is the spin operator for spin $i$. The model assumes that the spins are spin-1/2 particles, which is a common assumption in many-body systems.

The model is characterized by its simplicity and its ability to capture the essential features of more complex systems. It is particularly useful in the study of quantum spin liquids, where it has been used to describe the ground state and anyonic excitations.

#### 5.5b.2 Ground State of the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model

The ground state of the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model is a state of minimum energy. It is typically a many-body state, and its properties depend on the specific details of the system, such as the strength of the exchange interactions and the geometry of the system.

In the case of the strongly correlated quantum spin liquid (SCQSL), the ground state is a state of heavy fermions. This is due to the Kondo effect, which leads to a peak in the density of states near the Fermi level. This phenomenon has been observed in various materials, including heavy fermion systems and quantum spin liquids.

#### 5.5b.3 Anyonic Excitations in the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model

In addition to its ground state, the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model also exhibits a variety of interesting excitations. These excitations, known as anyons, are quantum mechanical particles that exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. They are a direct consequence of the entangled spin states in the model, and their existence has been confirmed through various experimental techniques.

The first direct measurement of a quantum spin liquid of the toric code type was reported in December 2021. This was achieved by two teams: one exploring ground state and anyonic excitations on a quantum processor, and the other implementing a theoretical blueprint of atoms on a ruby lattice held with optical tweezers on a quantum simulator. This breakthrough has opened up new avenues for studying the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model and its properties.

#### 5.5b.4 Experimental Signatures and Probes of the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model

Since the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model is a fundamental model in the study of quantum spin liquids, it has been extensively studied using various experimental techniques. These techniques include neutron scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and optical spectroscopy. Each of these techniques provides a unique perspective on the model, allowing for a more complete understanding of its properties.

In addition to these experimental techniques, the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model has also been studied using numerical methods, such as density functional theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. These methods have been used to explore the model in systems of varying size and complexity, providing valuable insights into its behavior.

In conclusion, the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model is a fundamental model in the study of quantum spin liquids. Its simplicity and relevance to real-world systems make it a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of spins in many-body systems. Its ground state and anyonic excitations have been extensively studied using various experimental techniques, providing a deeper understanding of its properties.




### Subsection: 5.5c Variational and Monte Carlo Methods for Spin Liquids

In the previous section, we discussed the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model and its ground state. In this section, we will explore two powerful computational methods that have been used to study quantum spin liquids: the Variational Method and the Monte Carlo Method.

#### 5.5c.1 Variational Method for Spin Liquids

The Variational Method is a powerful tool for studying the ground state of quantum systems. It is based on the principle of variational calculus, which allows us to systematically improve our approximation of the ground state energy by adjusting the parameters of a trial wave function.

In the context of quantum spin liquids, the Variational Method has been used to study the ground state of the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Model. The trial wave function is typically chosen to be a product of one-body wave functions, reflecting the fact that the spins in a quantum spin liquid are strongly correlated.

The Variational Method has been instrumental in the discovery of the heavy fermion ground state in quantum spin liquids. By systematically improving the trial wave function, researchers have been able to approach the ground state energy of the system, providing valuable insights into the properties of the ground state.

#### 5.5c.2 Monte Carlo Method for Spin Liquids

The Monte Carlo Method is another powerful tool for studying quantum systems. It is based on the principle of statistical mechanics, which allows us to sample the configuration space of a system and estimate its properties.

In the context of quantum spin liquids, the Monte Carlo Method has been used to study the thermodynamic properties of the system, such as the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility. By sampling the configuration space of the system, the Monte Carlo Method provides a way to estimate these properties, which can then be compared with experimental data.

The Monte Carlo Method has been particularly useful in the study of quantum spin liquids, due to the difficulty of analytically solving the equations of motion for these systems. By providing a way to estimate the properties of the system, the Monte Carlo Method has been instrumental in the discovery of new phases of matter, such as the heavy fermion ground state.

#### 5.5c.3 Comparison of the Variational and Monte Carlo Methods

Both the Variational Method and the Monte Carlo Method have been used to study quantum spin liquids. While they are both powerful tools, they have different strengths and weaknesses.

The Variational Method is particularly useful for studying the ground state of a system, due to its ability to systematically improve the approximation of the ground state energy. However, it can be challenging to apply to systems with a large number of particles, due to the computational cost of optimizing the trial wave function.

On the other hand, the Monte Carlo Method is particularly useful for studying the thermodynamic properties of a system. However, it can be challenging to apply to systems with a large number of particles, due to the computational cost of sampling the configuration space.

In practice, both methods have been used in conjunction to provide a more complete understanding of quantum spin liquids. By combining the strengths of both methods, researchers have been able to make significant progress in the study of these fascinating systems.




### Subsection: 5.5d Applications of Quantum Spin Liquids in Condensed Matter Physics

Quantum spin liquids have found numerous applications in condensed matter physics, particularly in the study of high-temperature superconductivity and topological quantum computation.

#### 5.5d.1 High-Temperature Superconductivity

In 1987, Phil Anderson proposed a theory that described high-temperature superconductivity in terms of a disordered spin-liquid state. This theory, known as the Anderson theory, suggested that the spin-liquid state is a precursor to superconductivity in these materials. The theory has been instrumental in the study of high-temperature superconductivity and has led to the discovery of new materials with even higher critical temperatures.

#### 5.5d.2 Topological Quantum Computation

Quantum spin liquids have also found applications in the field of quantum computation. The long-range quantum entanglement and fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids make them ideal candidates for topological quantum computation. This is because topological quantum computation relies on the manipulation of quantum states that are protected from local perturbations by topological order. The fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids provide a natural realization of these topological quantum states.

#### 5.5d.3 Materials Supporting Quantum Spin Liquids

Materials supporting quantum spin liquid states may have applications in data storage and memory. The long-range quantum entanglement in these materials can be used to store and retrieve information in a highly efficient manner. Furthermore, the absence of ordinary magnetic order in quantum spin liquids makes them immune to magnetic noise, making them ideal for applications in quantum computation.

In conclusion, quantum spin liquids have found numerous applications in condensed matter physics, particularly in the study of high-temperature superconductivity and topological quantum computation. The unique properties of quantum spin liquids, such as their long-range quantum entanglement and fractionalized excitations, make them a rich area of study and a promising field for future applications.

### Introduction

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a powerful computational tool used in the field of condensed matter physics. It is a many-body theory that allows us to calculate the electronic structure of a system by solving the Schrödinger equation for the system as a whole, rather than for each individual particle. This approach is particularly useful for systems with a large number of interacting particles, such as atoms, molecules, and solids.

## Chapter 6: Density Functional Theory:




### Section 6.1 Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems:

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems are fundamental to the understanding of density functional theory (DFT). They provide a mathematical framework for the description of the ground state of a many-body system, and have been instrumental in the development of DFT as a powerful tool for the study of condensed matter systems.

#### 6.1a Definition and Properties

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems are a set of two theorems that describe the ground state of a many-body system. The first theorem states that the ground state density of a system is a unique functional of the external potential. This means that the ground state density of a system can be determined by knowing the external potential acting on the system. The external potential is the potential energy due to external forces, such as an electric field or a gravitational field.

The second theorem states that the ground state energy of a system is also a unique functional of the external potential. This means that the ground state energy of a system can be determined by knowing the external potential acting on the system. The ground state energy is the total energy of the system in its ground state.

These theorems have important implications for the study of many-body systems. They provide a way to calculate the ground state density and energy of a system, which are crucial for understanding the properties of the system. They also provide a mathematical framework for the development of DFT, which is a powerful tool for the study of many-body systems.

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems have been used to develop a number of variational methods for the calculation of the ground state density and energy of a system. These methods involve the minimization of a variational functional, which is a mathematical expression that depends on the density of the system. The variational functional is chosen such that it is always positive and has a minimum at the ground state density. By minimizing the variational functional, one can obtain an upper bound on the ground state energy of the system.

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems have also been used to develop the Kohn-Sham equations, which are a set of self-consistent integro-differential equations that describe the ground state of a system. These equations have been used to develop a number of computational methods for the study of many-body systems, including the linearized augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method and the linearized augmented-plane-wave orbital method.

In the next section, we will discuss the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems in more detail and explore their implications for the study of many-body systems.

#### 6.1b Density Functional and External Potential

The density functional and external potential play a crucial role in the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and the development of density functional theory. The density functional is a mathematical function that describes the ground state density of a system, while the external potential is the potential energy due to external forces acting on the system.

The density functional is defined as the ground state density of the system, denoted by $n_0(\mathbf{r})$. It is a functional of the external potential $v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r})$, meaning that it depends on the external potential at every point in space. This is a direct consequence of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, which state that the ground state density and energy of a system are unique functionals of the external potential.

The external potential is the potential energy due to external forces acting on the system. These forces can be due to an external electric field, a gravitational field, or any other external influence. The external potential is typically represented as $v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i v_i(\mathbf{r})$, where $v_i(\mathbf{r})$ is the potential energy due to the $i$th external force.

The density functional and external potential are related through the following equation:

$$
n_0(\mathbf{r}) = T_s[n_0] + \int \frac{\delta E_{\text{Hxc}}[n_0]}{\delta n(\mathbf{r}')} \delta n(\mathbf{r}') d\mathbf{r}',
$$

where $T_s[n_0]$ is the non-interacting kinetic energy functional, $E_{\text{Hxc}}[n_0]$ is the Hartree-exchange-correlation energy functional, and $\delta n(\mathbf{r}')$ is the variation in the density at point $\mathbf{r}'$. This equation is known as the Hohenberg-Kohn equation and it provides a way to calculate the ground state density of a system.

The external potential also plays a crucial role in the development of density functional theory. It is used to construct the one-body potential $v_{\text{SCE}}(\mathbf{r})$ in the strictly-correlated-electron density functional theory. This potential is used to approximate the Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the Kohn-Sham DFT approach. The approximation becomes exact in the limit of infinitely strong interaction, and it allows for the calculation of the Hartree-exchange-correlation energy functional $E_{\text{Hxc}}[n_0]$.

In conclusion, the density functional and external potential are fundamental concepts in density functional theory. They are closely related and play a crucial role in the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and the development of density functional theory. Understanding these concepts is essential for the study of many-body systems.

#### 6.1c Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems in Condensed Matter Physics

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems have been instrumental in the development of density functional theory and have found extensive applications in condensed matter physics. These theorems provide a mathematical framework for understanding the ground state of a many-body system, and have been used to develop a variety of computational methods for studying condensed matter systems.

In condensed matter physics, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems are often used in conjunction with the Kohn-Sham equations, which are a set of self-consistent integro-differential equations that describe the ground state of a system. These equations are derived from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and provide a way to calculate the ground state density and energy of a system.

The Kohn-Sham equations are given by:

$$
\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) + v_{\text{Hxc}}(\mathbf{r})\right) \phi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \varepsilon_i \phi_i(\mathbf{r}),
$$

where $v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r})$ is the external potential, $v_{\text{Hxc}}(\mathbf{r})$ is the Hartree-exchange-correlation potential, $\phi_i(\mathbf{r})$ is the wave function of the $i$th electron, and $\varepsilon_i$ is the energy of the $i$th electron.

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems also play a crucial role in the development of the linearized augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method and the linearized augmented-plane-wave orbital method. These methods are used to study the electronic structure of condensed matter systems and have been used to study a variety of systems, including metals, insulators, and semiconductors.

They provide a mathematical framework for understanding the ground state of a many-body system and have been used to develop a variety of computational methods for studying condensed matter systems.




### Subsection 6.1c Kohn-Sham Equations and Self-Consistent Field Method

The Kohn-Sham equations are a set of integro-differential equations that describe the behavior of the electrons in a many-body system. They are derived from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and are used to calculate the ground state density and energy of a system. The Kohn-Sham equations are given by:

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V_{\text{ext}}(r) + V_{\text{H}}(r) + V_{\text{XC}}(r)\right]\psi_i(r) = \epsilon_i\psi_i(r)
$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $m$ is the electron mass, $V_{\text{ext}}(r)$ is the external potential, $V_{\text{H}}(r)$ is the Hartree potential, $V_{\text{XC}}(r)$ is the exchange-correlation potential, $\psi_i(r)$ is the wave function of the $i$-th electron, and $\epsilon_i$ is the energy of the $i$-th electron.

The Kohn-Sham equations are used in conjunction with the self-consistent field method, which is a numerical technique for solving the Kohn-Sham equations. The self-consistent field method involves an iterative procedure where the potentials $V_{\text{H}}(r)$ and $V_{\text{XC}}(r)$ are calculated from the wave functions $\psi_i(r)$, and the wave functions are then updated using the new potentials. This process is repeated until the wave functions and potentials converge to a self-consistent solution.

The Kohn-Sham equations and the self-consistent field method have been used to study a wide range of many-body systems, including atoms, molecules, and solids. They have proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the properties of these systems, and have been instrumental in the development of density functional theory.

These theorems provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of many-body systems, and have been used to study a wide range of systems, from atoms and molecules to solids and liquids.

#### 6.1d.1 Ground State Energy and Density

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems provide a way to calculate the ground state energy and density of a many-body system. This is done by solving the Kohn-Sham equations, which are derived from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems. The Kohn-Sham equations are a set of integro-differential equations that describe the behavior of the electrons in a system. They are used to calculate the ground state density and energy of a system, and have been used to study a wide range of systems, from atoms and molecules to solids and liquids.

#### 6.1d.2 Exchange-Correlation Potential

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems also provide a way to calculate the exchange-correlation potential, which is a key component of the Kohn-Sham equations. The exchange-correlation potential is a potential energy that accounts for the correlations between the electrons in a system. It is a crucial component of the Kohn-Sham equations, and has been used to study a wide range of systems, from atoms and molecules to solids and liquids.

#### 6.1d.3 Variational Method

These theorems provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of many-body systems, and have been used to study a wide range of systems, from atoms and molecules to solids and liquids.




### Subsection 6.2a Kohn-Sham Equations and Their Physical Interpretation

The Kohn-Sham equations are a set of integro-differential equations that describe the behavior of the electrons in a system. They are derived from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and are used to calculate the ground state density and energy of a system. The Kohn-Sham equations are given by:

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r})\right]\Psi_j^\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon_j^\mathbf{k}\Psi_j^\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})
$$

where $\Psi_j^\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})$ are the Kohn-Sham orbitals, $\epsilon_j^\mathbf{k}$ are the Kohn-Sham energies, $V_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r})$ is the effective potential, and $m$ is the electron mass.

The Kohn-Sham equations have a physical interpretation that is crucial to understanding the behavior of many-body systems. The Kohn-Sham orbitals, $\Psi_j^\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})$, represent the single-electron states in the system. These states are determined by the effective potential, $V_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r})$, which accounts for the interactions between the electrons in the system. The Kohn-Sham energies, $\epsilon_j^\mathbf{k}$, represent the single-electron energies of the system. These energies are determined by the effective potential and the kinetic energy operator.

The Kohn-Sham equations can be used to calculate the ground state density and energy of a system. This is done by solving the equations for the Kohn-Sham orbitals and energies, and then using these values to calculate the ground state density and energy. The Kohn-Sham equations are also used in the variational method, which is a powerful tool for studying many-body systems.

In addition to their use in calculating the ground state density and energy, the Kohn-Sham equations also provide a way to calculate the exchange-correlation potential. This potential is a key component of the Kohn-Sham equations and accounts for the correlations between the electrons in a system. The exchange-correlation potential is given by:

$$
V_{\text{xc}}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\delta E_{\text{xc}}}{\delta n(\mathbf{r})}
$$

where $E_{\text{xc}}$ is the exchange-correlation energy and $n(\mathbf{r})$ is the electron density.

The Kohn-Sham equations and their physical interpretation provide a powerful framework for understanding the behavior of many-body systems. They have been used to study a wide range of systems, from atoms and molecules to solids and liquids, and have been instrumental in the development of density functional theory.





### Subsection 6.2b Exchange-Correlation Potential

The exchange-correlation potential, denoted as $V_{\text{xc}}(\mathbf{r})$, is a key component of the Kohn-Sham equations. It accounts for the correlations between the electrons in a system and is crucial for accurately describing the behavior of many-body systems.

The exchange-correlation potential is defined as the difference between the total potential and the sum of the one-body potentials. Mathematically, it is given by:

$$
V_{\text{xc}}(\mathbf{r}) = V_{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{r}) - \sum_j V_{\text{one-body}}(\mathbf{r}_j)
$$

where $V_{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{r})$ is the total potential, $V_{\text{one-body}}(\mathbf{r}_j)$ is the one-body potential of the $j$th electron, and the sum is over all electrons in the system.

The exchange-correlation potential can be further decomposed into the exchange potential, $V_{\text{x}}$, and the correlation potential, $V_{\text{c}}$. The exchange potential accounts for the antisymmetry of the electron wavefunction, while the correlation potential accounts for the correlations between the electrons.

The exchange-correlation potential is often approximated using the local density approximation (LDA) or the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). These approximations are based on the assumption that the exchange-correlation potential is a functional of the electron density.

In the context of density functional theory, the exchange-correlation potential plays a crucial role in the calculation of the total energy of a system. It is used in the Kohn-Sham equations to calculate the one-body potential, which is then used to calculate the total energy.

The exchange-correlation potential is also used in the calculation of the exchange-correlation hole, which is a key concept in density functional theory. The exchange-correlation hole is a region of space around an electron that is depleted of electrons due to the antisymmetry of the electron wavefunction. It is a measure of the correlations between the electrons in a system.

In summary, the exchange-correlation potential is a fundamental concept in density functional theory and plays a crucial role in the calculation of the total energy and the exchange-correlation hole. It is a key component of the Kohn-Sham equations and is used to account for the correlations between the electrons in a system.





### Subsection 6.2c Density Functional Approximations

In the previous section, we discussed the exchange-correlation potential and its role in density functional theory. In this section, we will delve deeper into the density functional approximations that are used to calculate the exchange-correlation potential.

The density functional theory is based on the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, which states that the ground-state energy of a system is a functional of the electron density. This theorem forms the basis of the density functional theory and is used to derive the Kohn-Sham equations.

The Kohn-Sham equations are a set of one-body equations that describe the behavior of the electrons in a system. They are derived from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and are used to calculate the one-body potential, which is then used to calculate the total energy of the system.

The exchange-correlation potential, $V_{\text{xc}}(\mathbf{r})$, is a key component of the Kohn-Sham equations. It accounts for the correlations between the electrons in a system and is crucial for accurately describing the behavior of many-body systems.

The exchange-correlation potential is often approximated using the local density approximation (LDA) or the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). These approximations are based on the assumption that the exchange-correlation potential is a functional of the electron density.

The LDA approximation assumes that the exchange-correlation potential is a constant within a small region of space and varies smoothly from one region to another. This approximation is often used in density functional theory due to its simplicity and ability to capture the behavior of many-body systems.

The GGA approximation, on the other hand, takes into account the gradient of the electron density. This allows for a more accurate description of the exchange-correlation potential, especially in systems with rapidly varying electron densities.

In addition to the LDA and GGA approximations, there are also more advanced density functional approximations such as the meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. These approximations combine the LDA and GGA approximations with other terms to improve the accuracy of the exchange-correlation potential.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of density functional theory in various systems, including atoms, molecules, and solids. We will also explore the limitations and future directions of density functional theory.


### Conclusion

## Chapter: Many-Body Theory for Condensed Matter Systems: A Comprehensive Introduction

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of many-body theory and its applications in condensed matter systems. We have discussed the mean-field theory, which is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of many-body systems. However, the mean-field theory is limited in its ability to capture the correlations between particles, which are crucial in many-body systems. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of correlations and explore the concept of correlation functions.

Correlation functions are mathematical objects that describe the correlations between particles in a many-body system. They provide a way to quantify the degree of correlation between particles and how these correlations affect the behavior of the system. In this chapter, we will discuss the different types of correlation functions and their properties. We will also explore how these functions can be used to study the behavior of many-body systems.

One of the key concepts in this chapter will be the two-point correlation function, which describes the correlation between two particles in a system. We will discuss how this function can be calculated and how it can be used to study the behavior of particles in a system. We will also explore the concept of the one-point correlation function, which describes the correlation of a particle with itself. This function is crucial in understanding the behavior of particles in a system and will be discussed in detail.

Furthermore, we will also discuss the higher-order correlation functions, which describe the correlations between more than two particles. These functions are essential in understanding the behavior of many-body systems, as they capture the complex interactions between particles. We will explore how these functions can be calculated and how they can be used to study the behavior of many-body systems.

In summary, this chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to correlation functions and their role in many-body theory. We will discuss the different types of correlation functions and their properties, as well as their applications in studying the behavior of many-body systems. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of correlation functions and their importance in understanding the behavior of many-body systems.

### Subsection 6.2d Applications of Kohn-Sham Equations in Condensed Matter Physics

The Kohn-Sham equations are a powerful tool in condensed matter physics, providing a means to calculate the electronic structure of a system. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the Kohn-Sham equations in condensed matter physics.

#### 6.2d.1 Band Structure Calculations

One of the most common applications of the Kohn-Sham equations is in the calculation of the band structure of a material. The band structure describes the allowed energy levels of the electrons in a material, and is crucial for understanding the electronic properties of a material.

The Kohn-Sham equations allow us to calculate the band structure of a material by solving the one-body equations for each electron in the material. This provides us with the one-body potential, which can then be used to calculate the total energy of the system. By varying the energy, we can determine the allowed energy levels of the electrons in the material.

#### 6.2d.2 Density of States

The Kohn-Sham equations can also be used to calculate the density of states of a material. The density of states describes the number of states available to the electrons at each energy level.

The density of states can be calculated by integrating the band structure over all energy levels. This provides us with the number of states available to the electrons at each energy level. This information is crucial for understanding the electronic properties of a material, as it determines the behavior of the electrons in the material.

#### 6.2d.3 Electronic Properties of Materials

The Kohn-Sham equations can also be used to calculate the electronic properties of materials. These properties include the electronic band gap, the effective mass of the electrons, and the electronic conductivity.

The electronic band gap is the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band. It is a crucial property for understanding the optical and electronic properties of a material. The effective mass of the electrons describes how the electrons move through the material, and is crucial for understanding the electronic conductivity of a material.

In conclusion, the Kohn-Sham equations are a powerful tool in condensed matter physics, providing a means to calculate the electronic structure of a material. They have a wide range of applications, including the calculation of the band structure, density of states, and electronic properties of materials.




### Section: 6.3 Exchange-Correlation Functionals:

In the previous section, we discussed the Kohn-Sham equations and their applications in condensed matter physics. In this section, we will delve deeper into the exchange-correlation functionals, which play a crucial role in density functional theory.

#### 6.3a Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Their Physical Interpretation

The exchange-correlation functional, denoted as $E_{xc}[n]$, is a fundamental concept in density functional theory. It is a functional of the electron density $n(\mathbf{r})$ and is defined as the difference between the total energy of the system and the sum of the one-body potential energy and the kinetic energy of the non-interacting system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
E_{xc}[n] = T_{\rm s}[n] + E_{\rm Hxc}[n] \approx T_{\rm s}[n] + V_{\rm ee}^{\rm SCE}[n]
$$

where $T_{\rm s}[n]$ is the non-interacting kinetic energy, $E_{\rm Hxc}[n]$ is the Hartree-exchange-correlation energy, and $V_{\rm ee}^{\rm SCE}[n]$ is the strictly-correlated-electron potential.

The exchange-correlation functional is a key component in density functional theory as it encapsulates the many-body interactions between the electrons in the system. It is a non-local functional, meaning that it depends on the electron density at all points in space, and is typically approximated using various functionals such as the local density approximation (LDA) or the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).

The physical interpretation of the exchange-correlation functional is closely related to the Kohn-Sham equations. The Kohn-Sham equations can be seen as a one-body approximation to the many-body problem, where the one-body potential includes the Hartree potential and the exchange-correlation potential. The exchange-correlation potential, $v_{xc}(\mathbf{r})$, is defined as the functional derivative of the exchange-correlation functional with respect to the electron density:

$$
v_{xc}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\delta E_{xc}[n]}{\delta n(\mathbf{r})}
$$

This potential plays a crucial role in determining the electronic structure of the system. It accounts for the correlations between the electrons and is responsible for the binding of the system.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the commonly used exchange-correlation functionals and their applications in condensed matter physics.

#### 6.3b Exchange-Correlation Functionals in Condensed Matter Physics

In condensed matter physics, the exchange-correlation functional plays a crucial role in understanding the electronic structure of materials. It is particularly useful in the study of strongly correlated electron systems, where the interactions between the electrons are so strong that they cannot be treated as independent particles.

One such approach is the strictly-correlated-electron density functional theory (SCE-DFT), which combines the SCE approach with the Kohn-Sham DFT approach. The one-body potential $v_{\rm SCE}(\mathbf r)$ in the SCE approach can be used to approximate the Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the Kohn-Sham DFT approach. This approximation becomes exact in the limit of infinitely strong interaction.

The SCE-DFT approach can be expressed as:

$$
F[n] = T_{\rm s}[n] + E_{\rm Hxc}[n] \approx T_{\rm s}[n] + V_{\rm ee}^{\rm SCE}[n]
$$

where $T_{\rm s}[n]$ is the non-interacting kinetic energy, $E_{\rm Hxc}[n]$ is the Hartree-exchange-correlation energy, and $V_{\rm ee}^{\rm SCE}[n]$ is the strictly-correlated-electron potential. This approach allows us to capture the effects of the strongly-correlated regime, as it has been recently shown in the first applications of this "KS-SCE DFT" approach to simple model systems.

Another important aspect of exchange-correlation functionals in condensed matter physics is their role in understanding the electronic properties of materials. The exchange-correlation potential, $v_{xc}(\mathbf{r})$, is defined as the functional derivative of the exchange-correlation functional with respect to the electron density:

$$
v_{xc}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\delta E_{xc}[n]}{\delta n(\mathbf{r})}
$$

This potential plays a crucial role in determining the electronic structure of the system. It accounts for the correlations between the electrons and is responsible for the binding of the system. In the next section, we will discuss some of the commonly used exchange-correlation functionals and their applications in condensed matter physics.

The SCE-DFT approach can be expressed as:

$$
F[n] = T_{\rm s}[n] + E_{\rm Hxc}[n] \approx T_{\rm s}[n] + V_{\rm ee}^{\rm SCE}[n]
$$

where $T_{\rm s}[n]$ is the non-interacting kinetic energy, $E_{\rm Hxc}[n]$ is the Hartree-exchange-correlation energy, and $V_{\rm ee}^{\rm SCE}[n]$ is the strictly-correlated-electron potential. This approach allows us to capture the effects of the strongly-correlated regime, as it has been recently shown in the first applications of this "KS-SCE DFT" approach to simple model systems.

#### 6.3b Local Density Approximation

The Local Density Approximation (LDA) is a widely used approximation for the exchange-correlation functional in density functional theory. It is based on the mean-field Hartree-Fock theory, where the one-body potential is given by the sum of the Hartree potential and the exchange potential. The LDA further approximates the correlation potential as the local density approximation to the correlation energy.

The LDA is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{LDA}[n] = \int \epsilon_{xc}^{LDA}(n(\mathbf{r})) n(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}
$$

where $\epsilon_{xc}^{LDA}(n(\mathbf{r}))$ is the local density approximation to the exchange-correlation energy. This approximation is often used in conjunction with the Kohn-Sham equations to solve the one-body problem.

The LDA has been successful in many applications, particularly in the study of metals. However, it has been found to be less accurate for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators. In these cases, more advanced approximations, such as the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), may be more appropriate.

#### 6.3c Generalized Gradient Approximation

The Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) is another commonly used approximation for the exchange-correlation functional in density functional theory. Unlike the LDA, which is based on the mean-field Hartree-Fock theory, the GGA is based on the Kohn-Sham equations with a non-local exchange-correlation potential.

The GGA is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{GGA}[n] = \int \epsilon_{xc}^{GGA}(n(\mathbf{r}), \nabla n(\mathbf{r})) n(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}
$$

where $\epsilon_{xc}^{GGA}(n(\mathbf{r}), \nabla n(\mathbf{r}))$ is the generalized gradient approximation to the exchange-correlation energy. This approximation takes into account the gradient of the electron density, which is crucial for systems with strong correlations.

The GGA has been shown to be more accurate than the LDA for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators. However, it is also more computationally intensive due to the non-local nature of the exchange-correlation potential.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the commonly used GGA functionals, such as the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the Perdew-Wang (PW) functional.

#### 6.3d Hybrid Functionals

Hybrid functionals are a class of exchange-correlation functionals that combine the mean-field Hartree-Fock theory with density functional theory. They are designed to overcome the limitations of both the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA).

The most common type of hybrid functional is the PBE0 functional, which is a combination of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the Hartree-Fock exchange. The PBE0 functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{PBE0}[n] = E_{xc}^{PBE}[n] + \frac{1}{2} E_{x}^{HF}[n]
$$

where $E_{xc}^{PBE}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the PBE functional, and $E_{x}^{HF}[n]$ is the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. The PBE0 functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators.

Another popular hybrid functional is the B3LYP functional, which is a combination of the Becke three-parameter exchange functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional. The B3LYP functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{B3LYP}[n] = E_{x}^{B3}[n] + E_{c}^{LYP}[n]
$$

where $E_{x}^{B3}[n]$ is the Becke three-parameter exchange energy, and $E_{c}^{LYP}[n]$ is the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation energy. The B3LYP functional is often used in quantum chemistry calculations.

Hybrid functionals have been shown to be more accurate than both the LDA and the GGA for a wide range of systems. However, they are also more computationally intensive due to the inclusion of the Hartree-Fock exchange.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the other commonly used exchange-correlation functionals, such as the TPSS functional and the M06 functional.

#### 6.3e Meta-Generalized Gradient Approximation

The Meta-Generalized Gradient Approximation (Meta-GGA) is a class of exchange-correlation functionals that extend the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA). The Meta-GGA functionals are designed to overcome the limitations of both the GGA and the hybrid functionals.

The most common type of Meta-GGA functional is the TPSS functional, which is a combination of the Tan-Parr-Szabo (TPS) functional and the Perdew-Wang (PW) functional. The TPSS functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{TPSS}[n] = E_{xc}^{TPS}[n] + \frac{1}{2} E_{xc}^{PW}[n]
$$

where $E_{xc}^{TPS}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the TPS functional, and $E_{xc}^{PW}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the PW functional. The TPSS functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators.

Another popular Meta-GGA functional is the M06 functional, which is a combination of the M06-2X functional and the M06-L functional. The M06 functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{M06}[n] = E_{xc}^{M06-2X}[n] + E_{xc}^{M06-L}[n]
$$

where $E_{xc}^{M06-2X}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the M06-2X functional, and $E_{xc}^{M06-L}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the M06-L functional. The M06 functional is often used in quantum chemistry calculations.

Meta-GGA functionals have been shown to be more accurate than both the GGA and the hybrid functionals for a wide range of systems. However, they are also more computationally intensive due to the inclusion of additional terms.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the other commonly used exchange-correlation functionals, such as the HSE functional and the SCAN functional.

#### 6.3f Strongly Correlated Electrons

Strongly correlated electrons are a class of systems where the electron-electron interactions are so strong that they cannot be adequately described by mean-field theories such as the Hartree-Fock theory. These systems often exhibit phenomena such as metal-insulator transitions, high-temperature superconductivity, and quantum phase transitions.

The density functional theory (DFT) has been extended to handle strongly correlated systems through the development of the strongly correlated electron (SCE) functional. The SCE functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{SCE}[n] = E_{xc}^{HF}[n] + E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]
$$

where $E_{xc}^{HF}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the Hartree-Fock theory, and $E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the DFT. The SCE functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators.

The SCE functional is often used in conjunction with the Meta-GGA functionals to handle the long-range correlations in strongly correlated systems. This combination of functionals, known as the SCE-Meta-GGA, has been shown to be particularly effective for systems with strong correlations.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the other commonly used exchange-correlation functionals for strongly correlated systems, such as the HSE functional and the SCAN functional.

#### 6.3g Hedin's Equations

Hedin's equations, also known as the GW approximation, are a set of coupled integro-differential equations that describe the electronic structure of a system. These equations are derived from the Dyson equation, which relates the Green's function of a system to its self-energy. The GW approximation is a mean-field theory that is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as strongly correlated electrons.

The GW approximation is defined as:

$$
G = G_0 + G_0\Sigma G
$$

where $G$ is the Green's function, $G_0$ is the non-interacting Green's function, and $\Sigma$ is the self-energy. The self-energy is given by the sum of the Hartree term and the screened Coulomb interaction term:

$$
\Sigma = \Sigma_H + \Sigma_{SC}
$$

where $\Sigma_H$ is the Hartree term and $\Sigma_{SC}$ is the screened Coulomb interaction term. The screened Coulomb interaction term is given by:

$$
\Sigma_{SC} = \int d\omega d\omega' G_0(\omega')\chi(\omega-\omega')G_0(\omega)
$$

where $\chi$ is the response function.

The GW approximation has been used to study a wide range of systems, including metals, insulators, and strongly correlated systems. It has been particularly successful in describing the electronic structure of metals, where it has been used to calculate properties such as the electronic band structure and the optical conductivity.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the other commonly used exchange-correlation functionals for strongly correlated systems, such as the HSE functional and the SCAN functional.

#### 6.3h HSE Functional

The HSE (Hartree-Fock-Exchange) functional is a hybrid functional that combines the Hartree-Fock theory and the DFT. The HSE functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as strongly correlated electrons.

The HSE functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{HSE}[n] = E_{xc}^{HF}[n] + E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]
$$

where $E_{xc}^{HF}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the Hartree-Fock theory, and $E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the DFT. The HSE functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators.

The HSE functional is often used in conjunction with the Meta-GGA functionals to handle the long-range correlations in strongly correlated systems. This combination of functionals, known as the HSE-Meta-GGA, has been shown to be particularly effective for systems with strong correlations.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the other commonly used exchange-correlation functionals for strongly correlated systems, such as the SCAN functional and the HSE06 functional.

#### 6.3i SCAN Functional

The SCAN (Strongly Correlated Electrons with Asymptotic Normality) functional is a hybrid functional that combines the Hartree-Fock theory and the DFT. The SCAN functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as strongly correlated electrons.

The SCAN functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{SCAN}[n] = E_{xc}^{HF}[n] + E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]
$$

where $E_{xc}^{HF}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the Hartree-Fock theory, and $E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the DFT. The SCAN functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators.

The SCAN functional is often used in conjunction with the Meta-GGA functionals to handle the long-range correlations in strongly correlated systems. This combination of functionals, known as the SCAN-Meta-GGA, has been shown to be particularly effective for systems with strong correlations.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the other commonly used exchange-correlation functionals for strongly correlated systems, such as the HSE06 functional and the HSE06-Meta-GGA functional.

#### 6.3j HSE06 Functional

The HSE06 (Hartree-Fock-Exchange with 06% of DFT) functional is a hybrid functional that combines the Hartree-Fock theory and the DFT. The HSE06 functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as strongly correlated electrons.

The HSE06 functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{HSE06}[n] = (1-0.06)E_{xc}^{HF}[n] + E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]

#### 6.3k SCAN06 Functional

The SCAN06 (Strongly Correlated Electrons with 06% of DFT) functional is a hybrid functional that combines the Hartree-Fock theory and the DFT. The SCAN06 functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as strongly correlated electrons.

The SCAN06 functional is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{SCAN06}[n] = (1-0.06)E_{xc}^{HF}[n] + E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]
$$

where $E_{xc}^{HF}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the Hartree-Fock theory, and $E_{xc}^{DFT}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy of the DFT. The SCAN06 functional is particularly useful for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Many-Body Physics in Condensed Matter

### Introduction

The study of many-body systems is a fundamental aspect of condensed matter physics. This chapter, "Many-Body Physics in Condensed Matter," delves into the intricate world of these systems, exploring their unique properties and behaviors. 

Many-body systems are characterized by a large number of interacting particles, such as electrons, ions, and phonons. These interactions can lead to complex phenomena, including phase transitions, collective behavior, and emergent properties. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for a wide range of applications, from materials science to quantum computing.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles and techniques used to study many-body systems in condensed matter physics. We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of many-body physics, including the mean-field theory and the Hartree-Fock approximation. We will then delve into more advanced topics, such as the density functional theory and the Green's function method.

We will also discuss the role of many-body interactions in various condensed matter phenomena, such as superconductivity, magnetism, and phase transitions. We will explore how these interactions can be manipulated to control and optimize these phenomena for practical applications.

Throughout the chapter, we will use the mathematical language of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics to describe these concepts. For example, we will use the Schrödinger equation to describe the evolution of a many-body system, and the Boltzmann distribution to describe the statistical behavior of these systems.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles and techniques used to study many-body systems in condensed matter physics. You should also be able to apply these concepts to understand and predict the behavior of various condensed matter systems.




#### 6.3c Generalized Gradient Approximation

The Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) is a more advanced approximation for the exchange-correlation functional in density functional theory. It is based on the Kohn-Sham equations with a non-local exchange-correlation potential, and it takes into account the gradient of the electron density.

The GGA is defined as:

$$
E_{xc}^{GGA}[n] = \int \epsilon_{xc}^{GGA}(n(\mathbf{r}), \nabla n(\mathbf{r})) n(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}
$$

where $\epsilon_{xc}^{GGA}(n(\mathbf{r}), \nabla n(\mathbf{r}))$ is the generalized gradient approximation to the exchange-correlation energy. This approximation is often used in conjunction with the Kohn-Sham equations to solve the one-body problem.

The GGA is a more accurate approximation than the Local Density Approximation (LDA) for systems with strong correlations, such as insulators. However, it is still not perfect and can lead to errors in certain systems. For example, the GGA can overestimate the binding energy of molecules, leading to an overly positive value for the total energy.

Despite its limitations, the GGA is still a widely used approximation in density functional theory due to its computational efficiency and ability to capture many important physical properties. It is also the basis for many more advanced approximations, such as the Meta-GGA and Hybrid Functionals, which aim to improve upon the GGA while still maintaining its computational efficiency.

In the next section, we will discuss some of these more advanced approximations and their applications in density functional theory.
